    "What Do the Statistics Say? When one thinks of \"hackingâ€, the image of a mastermind sitting behind a high tech computer with a multitude of wires snaking around comes to mind. What doesn't come to mind is a harmless, anonymous man sitting on the seat next to you on the bus or your co-worker with whom you share a Lyft every day. Unfortunately for us, visual hacking is a real threat to our security. The most common type of action leading to data breaches worldwide in 2017 was – you guessed that right – hacking. Stealing credentials is not that difficult, especially when all you have to do is just take a peek at the screen. While 80% of US internet users consider cybersecurity to be very important, the statistics pointing out screen snooping concerns are missing. This points us to a very obvious conclusion: most people do not feel threatened by visual hacking. When the Private Becomes Public Remote work is gaining traction as employers are starting to see positive results. Employees can work at a place of their choosing in a stress-free environment and consequently bolster their productivity. It is all well and good, but the question is at what price? Considering that remote workers are often seen working in cafes, restaurants, buses, and other public places, anyone can attest to how easy it is to snoop on someone's screen. While most of us brush off the habit of screen snooping as rude and annoying, it becomes a real threat when you are employed at a place that deals with confidential information. The eyes of every onlooker become a threat. Suffice to say, an effective solution that does not hinder comfort and mobility is needed. What Solutions Do We Have? Visual hacking predates the digital age but is still as effective as it was before. But what solutions do we have available to us? The usual run of the mill answers are to \"Lock your computer when you are not using it,\" \"Be aware of your surroundings,\" \"Don't use public networksâ€, and so on. Pointing out the obvious, these are precautionary measures, not solutions. Screen Filters Also known as privacy filters, these screens work by admitting light only from certain angles. If someone sitting sideways tries to sneak a glance, they will only see a black screen. It's a good solution, true, but what about someone viewing from the same angle as you? Continuous Identification Systems Smart Eye Technology works primarily through facial recognition. The software unlocks the screen as soon as it recognizes – and here is the real kicker – it keeps running in the background as long you are facing the screen. As soon as you turn away, the screen either locks or blurs. As soon as you look back at the screen, it will automatically unlock. The best part about this smart technology is if you have a peeping tom right behind you looking at the screen, the software will instantly recognize the face and alert you.

Whether sharing internally with employees - working on-site or remotely, or externally with vendors or customers, Smart Eye Technology provides unprecedented data and information security. about some specific ways that Smart Eye Technology can help your business. Prevent Wire Fraud Protect Intellectual Property Secure Your Remote Work Office Ensure Safe Sharing of Sensitive Information Verify e-Signatures & Contracts Prevent Wire Fraud Fraudsters impersonating vendors are requesting wiring changes through email costing businesses upwards of 500 billion dollars a year. Our enterprise-level private communication platform only allows those companies you approve of to send or receive files from your organization. This puts an end to fraudulent wire changes sent by unapproved individuals or companies, saving your organization thousands of dollars. Protect Intellectual Property No matter what size your organization is, intellectual property is your most valuable asset. With Smart Eye Technology, you can restrict access to trade secrets including who can access it, for how long, and if they can share or download the information. Even if you send someone a confidential document, it is always only one-click away from terminated access. Secure Your Remote Work Office With more and more people working from home and other remote locations, document security risk has increased exponentially. While data interception and business email compromise present major challenges, an often-hidden risk is visual hacking from onlookers who see information they shouldn't have access to. Smart Eye Technology blocks unauthorized viewing — even at home - keeping confidential information, confidential. Ensure Safe Sharing of Sensitive Information Whether it's financial information or a personal photo, when you send a private or confidential document to someone you want it to stay private. Once you've sent it though, control is out of your hands. Smart Eye Technology ensures only the intended receiver can view or have access to it. What is meant to be for their eyes only, remains for their eyes only. Verify e-Signatures & Contracts Real estate agreements, project approvals, business deals – more and more often these are authorized through e-signature platforms for their convenience. However, e-signatures present potential litigation issues when a \"supposed signer†can more easily deny signing the document. Smart Eye Technology uses biometric authentication to ensure only the intended signer can e-sign your contract and provides the identity verification you need.
