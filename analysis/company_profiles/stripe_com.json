    "导言 What do registered agents do? Who needs a registered agent? How do registered agents operate in Delaware? How to choose a registered agent When should you get a registered agent? How to change your registered agent How much do registered agents cost? Get started with Stripe A registered agent is a designated person or business that receives official government documents and legal notices on behalf of a business. Registered agents help businesses comply with legal requirements such as staying informed about lawsuits or other legal actions. The agent must have a physical address (not a P.O. box) in the state where the business is registered and must be available during normal business hours to receive documents. This position facilitates communication between the government and the business, making sure the business is aware of and responds to legal matters appropriately. Below is an overview of what businesses need to know about registered agents, including what they do, when you might need one, and how to pick one. Here's what you should know. What's in this article? What do registered agents do? Who needs a registered agent? How do registered agents operate in Delaware? How to choose a registered agent When should you get a registered agent? How to change your registered agent How much do registered agents cost? What do registered agents do? Registered agents accept legal documents and government correspondence on behalf of businesses, helping business owners maintain privacy by letting them keep their personal address off public records. Registered agents must be available at their designated address during standard business hours to accept documents in person, ensuring the business does not miss important information because of unavailability. In addition to receiving documents and passing them along to the business, registered agents might take on responsibilities such as reminding the business of important filing dates (e.g., business registration renewal dates, tax filing dates). Legal documents: Registered agents accept service of process, which means they receive legal documents on behalf of the business in the event of a lawsuit. Government correspondence: Registered agents receive official government communications including tax forms, compliance documents, and notices of legal requirements or changes in laws that could affect the business. Who needs a registered agent? Most formally registered businesses need a registered agent to fulfill legal requirements and ensure they receive important communications. Businesses must keep their registered agent's information up to date and inform the state promptly if their registered agent changes. Corporations: S corporations and C corporations must have a registered agent. Limited liability companies (LLCs): LLCs must have a registered agent. Partnerships: Many states, including Delaware and California, require limited partnerships (LPs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) to have a registered agent. Nonprofits: Nonprofit entities must have registered agents. Businesses registered in multiple states: Businesses that operate in multiple states typically must have a registered agent in each of those states. How do registered agents operate in Delaware? Delaware is popular for business registration because of its business-friendly laws and courts. About 79% of all US initial public offerings in 2022 were registered in Delaware. Registered agents function the same way in Delaware as in other states: they receive legal documents and government correspondence on behalf of the business and forward those items promptly, enabling the business to keep up with its legal obligations. Registered agents in Delaware are also required to maintain current contact information for the business, ensuring the state has a reliable way to communicate with the business. Registered agents might also assist businesses with Delaware's annual report filing and franchise tax requirements, by reminding the business about these obligations or facilitating their completion. In Delaware, registered agents also create a legal presence for businesses that do not have a physical presence in the state. Delaware's laws allow businesses to be registered in the state without having a physical office or operations there, so long as they have a registered agent in the state . Given Delaware's status as a hub for corporate registrations, many businesses opt to use professional registered agent services in the state to take advantage of their expertise and ensure compliance. How to choose a registered agent Consider these factors to help you choose the right registered agent or service for your business: Requirements: Learn your state's requirements for registered agents. In Delaware, as in many other states, the agent must have a physical address (not a P.O. box) and be available during normal business hours. Reliability: Your agent or service should have a reputation for reliability and professionalism because they will handle important legal and tax documents. Look at reviews and testimonials from other businesses or ask for recommendations from your business network, attorneys, or accountants. Accessibility: Your registered agent should be easily accessible and prompt in communicating with you. Timely access to legal documents is important, especially if they are time-sensitive. Specific experience: Your agent or service should be familiar with the needs and compliance requirements of your business type, whether it's an LLC, corporation , nonprofit, or partnership. Compliance: Your agent should have a good track record of keeping their clients compliant with state regulations. This includes timely forwarding of all documents and notifications of any compliance changes. Confidentiality: Your registered agent should have measures in place to protect the confidentiality and security of your documents. Services: Some registered agents offer additional services such as compliance assistance, annual report filing reminders, and document organization. Determine which additional services might be beneficial for your business. Cost: Costs vary between agents and services. Fees are typically $100 to $200 per year in Delaware. Compare pricing, but be wary of extremely low prices that might indicate a lack of service quality or hidden fees. National coverage: If you plan to operate your business in multiple states, consider whether the agent or service can provide registered agent services in all the states where your business will be active. Switching costs: Understand the process and any fees associated with changing registered agents if you decide to switch services. When should you get a registered agent? These scenarios require choosing a registered agent to receive official documents: Starting a business: You need to choose a registered agent when registering a formal business such as a corporation or an LLC . Doing business in a new state: If you're expanding your business to operate in a new state, you need to pick a registered agent in that state. Changing your business type: If you decide to change how your business is set up, such as going from a solo operation to an LLC, you'll need a registered agent. Needing more availability: If you're not always at your business to receive important mail during regular hours, having a registered agent can help make sure you don't miss any important documents. How to change your registered agent Select a new agent: Before making any changes to your existing agent, choose your new registered agent. Ensure the new agent agrees to the role and meets your state's requirements, such as having a physical address in the state and being available during business hours. Check state procedures: Each state has its own process for changing a registered agent. Visit your state's secretary of state website or contact their office to get the specific forms and instructions for your state. Fill out the required forms: You'll typically need to complete a \"Change of Registered Agent†form or similar document, providing details about your business and the information for the old and new agents. Submit the form: Submit the completed form and any necessary payment (some might come with fees) to the state office. Notify your former agent: Inform your current agent that you're changing to a new one and that they'll no longer receive documents for your business. Update your records: Once the change is official, update any business records that list your registered agent. This might include bank records, licenses, or contracts. Confirm the change: Verify with your state's office that the change has been processed. Some states provide confirmation or a new certificate of status reflecting the change. How much do registered agents cost? Registered agent fees vary based on the state and whether you choose an individual or a professional service. Individual agent fees: If you appoint an individual such as an attorney or an accountant as your registered agent, the cost could range from a minimal fee to several hundred dollars annually, depending on their rates and services provided. Professional service fees: For a professional registered agent service, annual fees typically range from about $50 to $300. The cost depends on the level of services offered. Some providers might offer basic services at lower rates, while comprehensive packages that include additional business services might be at the higher end of this range. State fees: If you're changing your registered agent or registering a new business, the state might charge a filing fee. In Delaware, the change of agent filing fee is $50. 本文中的内容仅供一般信æ¯å'Œæ•™è'²ç›®çš\",ä¸åº\"被解释为法律或税务建议。Stripe ä¸ä¿è¯æˆ–æ‹…ä¿æ–‡ç« ä¸­ä¿¡æ¯çš\"准确性ã€å®Œæ•´æ€§ã€å……分性或时效性ã€'æ'¨åº\"该寻æ±'在æ'¨çš\"叿³•管辖区获得执业许å¯çš\"åˆæ ¼å¾‹å¸ˆæˆ–会计师的建议,以就您的特定情况æä¾›å»ºè®®ã€' What do registered agents do?

    "导言 What third sector organizations are The requirements to be considered a third sector organization Business activities Allocation of assets Registration with RUNTS Financial statements and reports of third sector organizations Tax benefits for third sector organizations Distinction between commercial and non-commercial TSOs The determination of flat-rate income tax for non-commercial TSOs Other tax benefits for TSOs Get started with Stripe On June 18, 2016, the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic announced the entry into force of Italian Law 106/2016. This law empowers the government to reform the third sector, leading to the issuance of three implementing decrees: one relating to the institution of the \" Five per thousand †donation (Italian Legislative Decree 111/2017), one relating to the reform of social businesses (Italian Legislative Decree 112/2017), and lastly, one relating to the \"Codice del Terzo settore†(Third Sector Code) - Italian Legislative Decree 117/2017. The purpose outlined in the delegated law was to organically reorganize and overhaul the third sector, which is typically characterized by severe lack of regulatory consistency and a high degree of stratification. In this article, you will find out what third sector organizations (TSOs) are, the requirements to be one, and the related tax benefits. What's in this article? What third sector organizations are The requirements to be considered a third sector organization Financial statements and reports of third sector organizations Tax benefits for third sector organizations What third sector organizations are To understand what TSOs are, it is important to first understand what the third sector is. The \"third†sector is distinct from government agencies (the first sector) and private businesses (the second sector). It includes organizations that perform, exclusively or primarily, activities of public interest and have nonprofit status. Specifically, TSOs include: Volunteer organizations Social promotion associations Philanthropic organizations Social businesses, including social cooperatives; association networks; mutual aid businesses; and nonprofit associations (recognized or unrecognized), foundations, and other private entities other than businesses established for the pursuit of community, charitable, and socially useful purposes It is important to note that the Third Sector Code excludes the following categories from the group of TSOs: Government departments Trade unions Professional and representative economic trade associations Political groups and associations Employers' associations Entities subject to coordination by one of the above-mentioned entities, with the exceptions specifically provided for under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Code The requirements to be considered a third sector organization The key requirements to join the list of TSOs mainly concern business activities, the allocation of assets, and registration with RUNTS (Registro Unico Nazionale del Terzo Settore, or Single National Register of the Third Sector). Let's take a look at these in more detail. Business activities Health care and social services Undergraduate and postgraduate education Nonscholastic training Scientific research of special social interest Education and vocational training Projects to protect and enhance cultural heritage and the landscape Organizing and managing cultural, artistic, or recreational activities of social interest Social housing Charity and child sponsorship Promoting and defending human rights Some of the business activities carried out may differ from those listed above, as long as they are permitted in the certificate of incorporation of the organization and are always instrumental and secondary to activities of public interest. Allocation of assets The second fundamental requirement to be defined as a TSO concerns having nonprofit status and earmarking special-purpose assets. Nonprofit status means that a TSO must allocate profits or surplus revenue to carrying out its statutory activities or to increasing its net worth. It therefore cannot distribute profits or surplus revenue, funds, or various reserves to founders, partners, employees, directors, and other members of corporate bodies. The only exception to this rule is the option for social businesses to allocate an amount less than 50% of annual profits and operating surpluses (less any losses accrued in previous years) toward: Increasing the share capital subscribed and paid up by members, free of charge, within the limits of the changes in the annual household of workers and employees consumer price index of Italy, calculated by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) for the period corresponding to the fiscal year in which the profits and surplus revenue were generated; or to the distribution, including through a free capital increase or the issuing of financial instruments, of dividends to shareholders—in an amount not exceeding the maximum interest on interest-bearing postal bonds, increased by two-and-a-half points over the actual paid-up capital. Unrestricted disbursements in favor of TSOs, other than social businesses, that are not founders, associates, or partners of a social business or subsidiaries thereof—aimed at promoting specific, socially useful projects. Registration with RUNTS One notable obligation for a TSO is for it to indicate its status in its corporate name. According to Articles 4 and 11 of the Third Sector Code, TSOs must register with the Single National Register of the Third Sector (RUNTS) and indicate the details of this registration in documents, correspondence, and public communications. TSOs that operate exclusively or primarily as a commercial business must also register in the trade register. For social businesses, registration in the special section of the trade register fulfills the requirement to register with RUNTS. The current registers have transferred the data of organizations already in the registers of voluntary work organizations and social promotion associations to the InfoCamere IT platform that manages the RUNTS on behalf of the relevant government ministry. The latter was in charge of providing for their transmigration. It is worth clarifying that registration with RUNTS is mandatory to obtain the designation of a TSO. Otherwise, registration is optional. Becoming a TSO and subsequently registering with RUNTS provides several benefits that we will clarify later in this article. Financial statements and reports of third sector organizations TSOs must keep financial statements and reports as follows: TSOs with revenue of less than €220,000 may keep financial statements in the form of a cash flow statement, showing total revenue and expenses. TSOs with revenue, income, proceeds, or other income equal to or exceeding €220,000 must prepare annual financial statements consisting of a balance sheet, profit and loss account (showing revenue and expenses), and mission statement (showing the items in the financial statements, the economic and financial performance of the organization, and how it pursues its statutory purposes). TSOs with revenue, income, proceeds, or other income in excess of €1 million must prepare a sustainability report in accordance with the guidelines for preparing TSO sustainability reports established by the relevant ministry and filing it with RUNTS, as well as publishing it on its website. Finally, TSOs with revenue, income, proceeds, or other income exceeding €100,000 must publish annually—and keep updated on their website—any case of remuneration, compensation, or fees attributed to members of administrative and control bodies, managers, and associates for any reason. Tax benefits for third sector organizations The Code of the Third Sector establishes tax obligations and benefits for TSOs based on the specific ways in which they carry out activities of public interest (Art. 5, Italian Legislative Decree no. 117/2017) and any secondary activities, as well as the nature of the organization and its organizational model. Some measures already came into effect on January 1, 2018. These are the benefit provisions that, while waiting for the RUNTS to become operational, already applied to non-profit organizations , social development associations and voluntary work organizations registered in their respective registries. Specifically, the measures include indirect tax concessions to provide incentives for organizations to purchase goods and resources. Distinction between commercial and non-commercial TSOs Regarding the taxation of income generated by TSOs, most financial incentives are based on the distinction between commercial and noncommercial TSOs, according to Article 79 of the Code of the Third Sector. For each area of activity of public interest, the organization must assess whether it carries out the activities in question free of charge or for a fee that does not exceed actual costs, in line with the 5% tolerance limit. You also need to know which items do not contribute to TSO revenue, such as: Funds received from occasional public collections Government grants and contributions for activities of public interest Sums paid by members as membership fees or contributions. The determination of flat-rate income tax for non-commercial TSOs For non-commercial entities, income taxes are determined on a flat-rate basis according to the following profitability coefficient: 销售收入 盈利系数 æœåŠ¡è¡¨çŽ° 其他活动 130,000 欧元以下 7% 5% 130,001 - 300,000 欧元 10% 7% 300,000 欧元以上 17% 14% For entities that simultaneously provide services and other activities, the coefficient is based on the revenue related to the main business activity. In the absence of a clear distinction between revenue from different sources, the provision of services is considered the main business activity. Making sure your business stays on top of constantly changing tax regulations can be especially complex. Tools such as Stripe Tax can help you simplify tax compliance by automatically generating detailed reports that are useful for filing tax returns. Other tax benefits for TSOs Other tax benefits for TSOs are as follows: Total exemption from stamp duty for any type of document For municipal property tax, the exception only applies to organizations that carry out particular activities that are performed in a noncommercial manner (as in the previous legislation) For direct property taxes, exemption applies to voluntary work organizations (including philanthropic organizations if already considered as such) and social development associations Exemption from government concession taxes Exemption from, or a fixed amount of, registration tax on amendments to bylaws required by law and other statutory amendments Other local taxes—for these taxes, local authorities may provide for a reduction or exemption Registration, mortgage, and cadastral taxes for real estate purchases—due in a fixed amount 本文中的内容仅供一般信æ¯å'Œæ•™è'²ç›®çš\",ä¸åº\"被解释为法律或税务建议。Stripe ä¸ä¿è¯æˆ–æ‹…ä¿æ–‡ç« ä¸­ä¿¡æ¯çš\"准确性ã€å®Œæ•´æ€§ã€å……分性或时效性ã€'æ'¨åº\"该寻æ±'在æ'¨çš\"叿³•管辖区获得执业许å¯çš\"åˆæ ¼å¾‹å¸ˆæˆ–会计师的建议,以就您的特定情况æä¾›å»ºè®®ã€' What third sector organizations are The requirements to be considered a third sector organization Business activities Allocation of assets Registration with RUNTS Financial statements and reports of third sector organizations Tax benefits for third sector organizations Distinction between commercial and non-commercial TSOs The determination of flat-rate income tax for non-commercial TSOs Other tax benefits for TSOs Distinction between commercial and non-commercial TSOs The determination of flat-rate income tax for non-commercial TSOs Other tax benefits for TSOs Get started with Stripe On June 18, 2016, the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic announced the entry into force of Italian Law 106/2016.

Tax benefits for third sector organizations The Code of the Third Sector establishes tax obligations and benefits for TSOs based on the specific ways in which they carry out activities of public interest (Art. 5, Italian Legislative Decree no. 117/2017) and any secondary activities, as well as the nature of the organization and its organizational model. Some measures already came into effect on January 1, 2018. These are the benefit provisions that, while waiting for the RUNTS to become operational, already applied to non-profit organizations , social development associations and voluntary work organizations registered in their respective registries. Specifically, the measures include indirect tax concessions to provide incentives for organizations to purchase goods and resources. Distinction between commercial and non-commercial TSOs Regarding the taxation of income generated by TSOs, most financial incentives are based on the distinction between commercial and noncommercial TSOs, according to Article 79 of the Code of the Third Sector. For each area of activity of public interest, the organization must assess whether it carries out the activities in question free of charge or for a fee that does not exceed actual costs, in line with the 5% tolerance limit. You also need to know which items do not contribute to TSO revenue, such as: Funds received from occasional public collections Government grants and contributions for activities of public interest Sums paid by members as membership fees or contributions. The determination of flat-rate income tax for non-commercial TSOs For non-commercial entities, income taxes are determined on a flat-rate basis according to the following profitability coefficient: For entities that simultaneously provide services and other activities, the coefficient is based on the revenue related to the main business activity. In the absence of a clear distinction between revenue from different sources, the provision of services is considered the main business activity.
