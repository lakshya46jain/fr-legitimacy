    "Enhancing Facial Recognition with 3D Technology for Safety and for Security StereoVision Imaging, Inc. (SVI), a leading developer of facial recognition technology, sees 3D real world data as a rich stream of naturally encoded statistics that can quickly resolve a face in the crowd in complex conditions and situations. Our patented technology captures imagery in 3D space through specialized binocular optics or commercial off-the-shelf fixed camera systems and extracts faces in 2D for real time comparison. Utilizing face matching algorithms traceable to NIST government evaluation, SVI's enhancement technology, co-developed and already in use by U.S. military and local/state law enforcement allows for facial recognition technology to now operate at extended ranges, indoors and/or outdoors under uncontrolled environmental conditions.",
