    "Choosing a fingerprinting solution Stytch vs. Fingerprint Fingerprint is a r of Stytch's strong tamper resistance is that Stytch's device fingerprinting product is built in WebAssembly for maximum obfuscation and to ensure that the product remains a black box. Fingerprint's solution is built in pure r of Stytch's strong tamper resistance is that Stytch's device fingerprinting product is built in WebAssembly for maximum obfuscation and to ensure that the product remains a black box. Fingerprint's solution is built in pure r of Stytch's strong tamper resistance is that Stytch's device fingerprinting product is built in WebAssembly for maximum obfuscation and to ensure that the product remains a black box. Fingerprint's solution is built in pure JavaScript, so its encryption and signal collection logic are subject to trivial interception via breakpoints. Solution approach Stytch's product is similar to Fingerprint's product in that they both offer highly accurate, globally unique, stable visitor IDs that can be used to understand website traffic and personalize the user experience on your site and block bad actors. Granularity != Accuracy However, the two products are very different in how they approach aggregating individual signals to help identify users and challenge or block suspicious traffic. Fingerprint.js provides users with a wide array of individual attributes, such as VPN detection, IP geolocation, and more. With Fingerprint , aggregating the output of these attributes to make a decision on what behavior to allow or disallow is up to you. An advantage of this approach is the ability to see and customize behavior based on raw device attributes; however, these individual signals are susceptible to large numbers of false positives and negatives. For example, Fingerprint's VPN detection is largely based on IP address lookups and timezone mismatch. While these factors are effective in a large number of cases, they're also imperfect and easily gamed by bad actors, leading to inaccurate data. In contrast, Stytch's solution looks holistically at the hardware, network, and browser-level profile of a website visitor and uses deterministic pattern matching to generate an action recommendation and a unique, stable fingerprint. This allows for a more streamlined implementation when using Stytch , and avoids creating an illusion of accuracy by presenting raw attributes that may not be fully reliable. Developer experience and performance Integration and support Both Stytch and Fingerprint are relatively lightweight to integrate, and can be configured in a matter of hours or days, depending on the use case. You can get a sense of what it looks like to get started with Stytch's device fingerprinting solution by referencing the docs . Stytch also offers top-notch support and integration guidance through our solutions engineering and developer success teams. Load times Performance is another critical dimension. A device or browser fingerprinting product needs to load quickly to avoid deterring legitimate users. In our testing, we found that Stytch's telemetry.js took an average of 250 ms to load when uncached (for new users) and 125 ms to load when cached. In contrast, Fingerprint Pro (v3.8.2) took an average of 650 ms to load when uncached and 550 ms to load when cached. In summary, Stytch was 4x faster than Fingerprint for returning users and 2x faster for new ones. Product connections Fingerprint offers a wider range of integrations with third party providers like Cloudflare or Microsoft Azure; however, Stytch's device fingerprinting product can be easily bundled with Stytch authentication to mitigate account takeover attacks, credential stuffing, toll fraud, and more. Pricing and packaging Purchasing options While Fingerprint's browser fingerprinting solution is a standalone product that can be optionally integrated with third party authentication solutions, Stytch's comprehensive product suite includes authentication as well as device fingerprinting. As a result, Stytch's device fingerprinting product can either be purchased standalone, similar to that of Fingerprint , or can be purchased as a built-in protection layer directly integrated into Stytch's authentication SDKs. This allows for flexible implementation of Stytch's device fingerprinting solution to prevent fraud, stop account takeover attacks, and accurately identify both users and bots. Pricing Pricing is comparable between Fingerprint Pro's and Stytch's device/browser fingerprinting solutions, and both companies charge based on API lookups. Stytch also offers bundling discounts for customers who use Stytch device fingerprinting in tandem with Stytch's authentication solutions, which provides both cost savings and additional protection against toll fraud , account takeovers , credential stuffing , and more. Set up a demo with the Stytch team to about pricing for device fingerprinting and to get set up with API credentials. Comparison details The comparisons above focus on Fingerprint Pro (v3.8.2) vs. Stytch Device Fingerprinting as of August 2023. The performance results were collected on both a M1 Macbook Pro and a Windows 10 PC with similar, repeatable results observed in both instances.

    "Choosing your authentication provider Stytch vs. AWS Cognito Cognito may be sufficient for those looking to build simple authentication flows centered around passwords and social OAuth logins. In particular, Cognito may appeal to companies already using AWS and looking for a basic low-cost solution. However, many companies may quickly outgrow Cognito - Stytch may be a better solution if you're looking for more advanced authentication features, maximum flexibility with your backend stack, and more hands-on support.

Device Fingerprinting features available in beta (device group classification, unique identifiers, suggested actions). \"Advanced Security†features starting at $0.050/MAU (password breach detection and adaptive authentication). How to migrate from Cognito to Stytch A more detailed comparison Product coverage One of the major differences between Stytch and Cognito is product coverage and the flexibility of authentication methods available. Fundamentally, Cognito only offers passwords and social OAuth logins as primary factors, so a truly passwordless experience is not possible. Cognito may work well for those already using AWS services and looking for basic login features, but those looking for more advanced authentication features such as biometrics, email magic links, or additional social OAuth providers like Slack, Discord, or Twitter will find that Stytch offers a wider breadth of solutions. Moreover, Stytch's API-first approach allows for maximum flexibility, enabling you to build more nuanced, custom authentication logic like just-in-time step-up challenges. On the other hand, Cognito's \"Advanced Security'' features only support MFA via SMS and TOTP (with some limited ability to build more custom flows with Challenge Lambda triggers). Furthermore, whereas one needs to add on Cognito's \"Advanced Security†features to check for compromised credentials, Stytch's Passwords product has breach detection and strength assessment built-in. In addition to authentication, Stytch also offers highly flexible fraud tools like Device Fingerprinting, which leverages a broad set of nuanced parameters that allow you to build more fine-grained logic around how to treat traffic by risk level. Moreover, these anti-bot and fraud prevention capabilities are embedded natively on Stytch's platform, reducing the need to rely on additional security vendors. Lastly, many of Stytch's products are built with edge cases in mind. For example, Stytch partners with multiple SMS/email providers, so one-time passcodes and email magic links have automatic failover protection to offer you maximum uptime and redundancy. Similarly, Stytch automatically deduplicates users who attempt to authenticate via multiple login methods. Approach to flexibility and scalability Cognito's Hosted UI The standard way to implement Cognito is using their \"Hosted UI,†a Cognito-owned modal that handles password and OAuth-based logins with some customization available. Because the UI is Cognito-hosted, it requires redirecting users away from your page/app, authenticating them on Cognito or a custom domain, then returning them to your page/app, which may hurt conversion. Stytch's flexible SDKs The easiest way to implement Stytch is using a frontend SDK (JavaScript, React Native, iOS) and either using a pre-built UI flow or custom-building your own with headless SDK methods (not available with Cognito). Unlike Cognito's Hosted UI, there is no redirect involved, and since you fully own the login page, there is a broader range of customization available. Fully owning the UI/UX is also possible using Stytch's API directly. Why you might choose Cognito's approach Cognito's Hosted UI may work well for those looking for a simple login page offering passwords and social OAuth with basic customization options. Some additional (though limited) custom logic can be implemented via Lambda triggers. Because the UI is Cognito-hosted, you have limited control over the performance, look-and-feel, and potential (breaking) changes to the login experience. Why you might choose Stytch's approach Stytch's approach may be a better fit for those seeking more flexibility and full control, both over the look-and-feel of the UI/UX and any nuanced authentication logic you're looking to layer on, enabling tighter integration with your stack. The lack of a redirect also typically offers a more seamless, higher-converting user experience ( Lighthouse improved conversion by 60% after switching to Stytch ). Approach to product development and support Cognito is a relatively small part of the broader AWS platform. In contrast, Stytch as a whole is focused on authentication, identity, and access management, meaning the company's attention and resources are directed towards building and maintaining this core functionality. Whereas one may find it hard to access the latest authentication innovations or receive timely support with Cognito, Stytch's sole focus on authentication means product resources are devoted to continued expansion of Stytch's solution suite to keep up with the latest technologies, and support resources are similarly devoted to customers' authentication issues and use cases. Approach to pricing In general, you'll find that Cognito comes out to a lower cost on a per-unit basis. There is a generous free tier with low pay-as-you-go rates for additional usage. However, fast-growing companies may also find that they quickly outgrow Cognito's more limited product offerings and technical support. Stytch's per-unit pricing is higher in general, though products tend to be more fully-featured than Cognito's. Moreover, generous volume discounts are available via a high-touch and collaborative sales process. Given Stytch's greater focus on product development and support, you'll also find more robust and up-to-date product features as well as more responsive support.
