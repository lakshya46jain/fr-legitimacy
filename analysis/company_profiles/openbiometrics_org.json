    "Overview OpenBR is a framework for investigating new modalities, improving existing algorithms, interfacing with commercial systems, measuring recognition performance, and deploying automated biometric systems. The project is designed to facilitate rapid algorithm prototyping, and features a mature core framework, flexible plugin system, and support for open and closed source development. Off-the-shelf algorithms are also available for specific modalities including face recognition , age estimation , and gender estimation . Please see the Tutorials section for more information. OpenBR originated within The MITRE Corporation from a need to streamline the process of prototyping new algorithms. The project was later published as open source software under the Apache 2 license and is free for academic and commercial use . Please read our paper for more information about OpenBR and kindly cite in your own work: J. Klontz, B. Klare, S. Klum, M. Burge, A. Jain, \"Open Source Biometric Recognitionâ€, Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems, 2013. The two principal software artifacts are the shared library 'openbr' and command line application 'br'. Install OpenBR is supported on multiple operating systems. Please select yours from the list below for installation instructions. Linux Mac OSX Windows Raspian Tutorials We recommend that first-time users of the OpenBR framework look at the following tutorials before moving on to the more in-depth documentation below.
