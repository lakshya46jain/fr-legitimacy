    "What is Computer Vision? Computer vision is the science of electronically perceiving and understanding an image. For decades computers have been blind - they have depended on humans to tag or label video in order to know what is happening in images. Now, computer vision has advanced to the stage where algorithms are used to detect, track and recognize objects and people in video streams. Soon, the ability to identify objects in video will become a baseline requirement for any video application or website. It will enable a wide range of new applications in entertainment, advertising and video search. Moving from Video Analytics to Computer Vision. Intelligent video surveillance Most offâ€theâ€shelf security applications available in consumer channels are not smart. They use motion detection to determine if moving objects are present in video. Motion detection analyzes how many pixels have changed between frames. When enough pixels change, video is recorded and/or the customer is notified of a \"motion event.†Unfortunately, pixels can also change with clouds passing overhead, leaves swaying in the wind, or flickering lights. More advanced systems let customers ignore selected regions in the video, or set sensitivity levels. Nevertheless, motion detection often generates an unacceptable number of false alerts. Computer vision isn't based on pixels moving, it works by learning what certain objects look like, in much the same way as a child learns. Computer vision can detect, track and recognize objects in a way that motion detectors can never achieve. about using Sighthound with your IP cameras to create an intelligent video security system. How does people detection work? Sighthound has a team of PhDs in computer vision making it possible for your computer to understand what your cameras are showing it. Inspired by the human intelligence model, Sighthound Video abandons the approach of rules based on box shape and movement. Instead, a learning network is trained with video clips of humans. The network is taught that these video clips represent people, and trained to learn that examples of vehicles and animals are not people. As a result, Sighthound Video has demonstrated a high degree of tolerance to realâ€world challenges relative to conventional methods. See people detection in action. What is Computer Vision?

    "Home Business Turn a webcam into a home security system There are many devices arriving in the market today that can help monitor your home while you are away. From old school nanny cams, to plug and play IP cams to devices that can report on room temperature and humidity levels. They all help to put home video surveillance into the hands of consumers, and that's a good thing. Many users have discovered that they can use the power of Sighthound Video to turn a webcam into a video surveillance system at little to no cost. What's more, the intelligent computer vision in Sighthound means that the system performs better than alternatives. 3 steps to creating the best webcam security system Turn an Android phone into a home security system If you happen to have an unused Android phone lying around, did you know you can turn it into a home video surveillance system? Not only can you create a free Wi-Fi camera system, but it actually has advantages over tailor-made systems. For one, you have it up and running long before Amazon delivers your shiny new nanny-cam. Even better, it comes with its own battery back-up, and when used with Sighthound Video, you get to choose your own cloud storage service and keep control over access to your videos. A great way to monitor your garage, your pets or your stuff. Step by step instructions for turning a phone into a home security system. DIY Security System Do home owners still need to use video security system installers? With easily available IP cameras, all a homeowner needs for a DIY home security system is a computer and software that doesn't require a PhD to set up. Sighthound Video was designed for users setting up their own IP camera security system. It is easy to download and easy to use. There is a starter version that is free to try, so users don't have to speculate about whether it will work with their systems. It installs and, in most cases, finds any cameras connected to the network automatically. Best of all, Sighthound Video doesn't just allow live viewing and historical review of the footage, it uses highly advanced computer vision to detect whether a person is in the video feed. Download Sighthound Video for FREE Packaging Monitoring Want to get an alert when someone leaves a package on your porch or when the mailman comes? Sometimes having Sighthound as your home video security system can pay off big time, such as when the postal service claims that those tickets you've been waiting for have been delivered, but you know something different happened.
