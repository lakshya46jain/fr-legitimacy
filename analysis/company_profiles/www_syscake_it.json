Rispondiamo tutte le tue domande Are the requests actually unlimited? Yes, kinda. Good Time doesn't charge hourly or per project. Instead, you'll get access to our Trello board where you can add as many requests as you'd like. We'll work our way through them in your preferred order. Which plan is right for me? Each plan has a short explanation for whom it could be for and the services it includes. If you have a need and you're not sure which plan you should choose, you can message us and we'll try to help you figure out which plan is right for you. How do I cancel my account? Go to account after logging in. Cancel anytime before your next recurring payment and you won't be charged. Forget to cancel the following month without using any asks? Let us know and we'll make it right. Are the payments monthly? Can I pay for longer? You pay monthly instead of hourly or by the project. It's simpler and lets you choose how long we work together. It's less complicated this way and gives you enough time to see if it's right for your brand. If you want a longer plan duration, try out a month or so first. If we're a good fit for each other, we'll make it happen. What kind of services do you offer? Check out the services section just above here to see the some of the services we offer in our plans. What do you use to make things? We currently use Figma for designs, Photoshop/Illustrator for print and photo-based asks, Webflow for developing websites, and After Effects for animations. How long will it take to fill a request? Because each and every request is different, it's hard to guarantee anything here but our general rule of thumb for a typical request is two business days. A typical request could be a landing page or logo. A non-typical request could extend out from there, which could be a request for multiple landing pages, a robust e-book, etc. In this case, you may receive multiple deliveries until the request is complete. Are there any contracts to use your services? There are no contracts or commitments to use our service. You can cancel at any time and return at any time. We are flexible and understand you may not have a consistent need for designs every single month. Why isn't Good Time available on Fridays? We're trying the 32-hour workweek out. During the industrial era, capitalism predicted that we'd work fewer hours when services become more automated. Turns out, we ended up working more. We want to subvert that expectation and use that extra day to take care of ourselves mentally and physically. Be kind to yourself. What happens if you get too many clients? Will I get bad product? We limit the amount of clients we can take on so that the quality is never spread too thin. If we open up more slots, we'll hire more designers and developers to fill that gap. Tell us about your idea Whether you are an individual or a company, we concretely realize your needs and bring your vision to life. Grazie! La tua richiesta è stata ricevuta.
