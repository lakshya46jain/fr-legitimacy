    "Faceware Portal is our AI-powered cloud-based platform that generates animation and retargeting data automatically. Go from video capture to final animation faster and easier, increasing your team's efficiency and enabling you to create more content than ever. Faceware Studio is a high-quality, realtime animation software that tracks facial movement from live or recorded video. It uses state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques to track your face and create animation in realtime. Analyzer is our standalone facial tracking software. Analyzer converts video of facial performances into proprietary motion data that can be applied to any character via our Autodesk Retargeter Plug In. Retargeter is our animation and solving plug-in to common Autodesk animation products such as Maya, 3DS Max, and MotionBuilder. Retargeter takes the data from Analyzer and applies the motion to your characters through an intuitive and pose-based workflow. Reallusion's partnership with Faceware enables iClone to achieve real-time facial motion capture and recording. This will empower indies and studios of all levels, giving them access to facial motion capture tools that are fast, accurate and markerless—all from a PC webcam. Shepherd combines all the integral features a face capture operator needs in one innovative and thoughtful app. Sync your entire performance capture workflow with timecode support and additional functionality to lync your Vicon, Xsens or Optitrack system to trigger your facial systems.

Easily Adjust Camera Settings For Optimal Performance Realtime for iClone gives you access to any camera connected to your PC. Once a camera is selected, you can easily adjust settings such as video resolution and FPS to get the optimal performance from both your camera and the software. We recommend capturing your face at a minimum of 30 FPS (frames per second) though 60 FPS is ideal! You'll get higher fidelity lip sync animation at a higher FPS. We also recommend keeping the resolution at or below 720p for optimal use. Many people will find that the 640×480 resolution is more than enough. Fast and Simple Calibration Calibrating the technology to your face is an important part of how Realtime for iClone works. Calibration establishes a baseline by 'teaching' the technology what your face looks like in a neutral pose. Unlike other tracking software, calibration in Realtime for iClone is fast and simple, allowing you to train the technology in a single button press and adjust on-the-fly for optimal results. In the video tutorials created by Reallusion, you can see how Calibrating in slightly different poses might give you enhanced results in iClone. Compatible with Industry Standard 3D Characters iClone Characters made by Character Creator has updated with 60 face morphs, fully optimized for Faceware tracking data. For Daz Genesis, characters generation 1, 2, 3, and 8, auto-conversion tools and 60 face morph DUF profiles are provided. Distinguishing Features of Realtime for iClone Instant, dynamic feedback.

The Freedom to Perform With a 750ft (230 meter) range, zero delay and flawless HD video stream, your performance is streamed instantly, dependably. Untether your actor and unleash their full potential. The Mark IV Dual Band edition uses the Teradek Bolt 6 series system to wirelessly stream video from the headcam to the recording and monitoring devices. The Bolt 6 series supports both 5GHz and 6Ghz bands* to reduce interference and enable more performers to be captured simultaneously. *The Bolt 6's 6Ghz band is currently only certified for use in USA and Canada. Certification for other regions is expected to be approved soon. 750ft Range (230 meters) 99% of the World's Heads. A data-driven approach to headcam engineering. The Mark IV helmet was co-developed with one of the world's leading performance capture helmet manufacturers. We studied anthropomorphic head studies of thousands of subjects to create helmets that fit 99% of the world's heads, comfortably. 5 hours wireless per battery 15 hours wired 1 hour charge time We've created a substantial power system that uses an Anton/Bauer® Gold Mount Plate and a Bebob ® A45 Micro Battery that locks securely into place. Now you can shoot longer, with more reliability and less down time on set. Want to capture with audio? Our system is completely silent. Special low noise cable wrapping, magnetic shielding on the power cables, no fans, no heavy PC wearables, just silent wireless video capture that is streamed or recorded in realtime. Our custom-built breakout box and streamlined cabling feature premium, robust cable connections to stand up to the rigors of being on-set. Full Performance Capture with Shepherd Full face and body performance capture is streamlined when you use Faceware Shepherd with your Mark IV headcam. Shepherd automates headcam recording functions and integrates with body motion capture systems, like Vicon and Optitrack, to synchronise facial and body mocap recordings on PCs and Windows tablets. Commonly asked questions about the Mark IV How long does it take to set up an actor? As a new user, it may take 10 to 15 minutes to properly fit an actor's helmet, build the headcam, and frame and focus the actor's face. Once you've mastered this process, it'll get much faster. It takes roughly 5 to 7 minutes per actor for Headcam operators to do this process. Once the actor has a helmet and camera fit and framed, things go even faster. For example, coming back from a break or lunch takes about a minute to get the Mark IV back on them. How long does it take to calibrate the system? No calibration process is necessary for our Mark IV Headcam to be used for recording. If you plan to use Live Studio (Faceware's realtime software), have the actor hold a neutral face, and Live Studio has a 1 button, 1-second calibration process. What is the battery life of the system? If the Mark IV System is running in wireless mode, then a single battery will last approximately 5 hours. If the Mark IV System is wired, then a single battery will last at least 12 hours. Do you recommend applying facial markers to the performer's face? This is entirely up to the person who will track the footage in Analyzer, our technology does not require markers, although about 1/2 our user-base prefers to apply marks on the face. Markers drawn on the actor's faces can help with consistent landmark placement but does not directly impact how the software ingests the data. Small, clean dots, placed consistently day to day work best. Your bar seems long. Why is that? We use a near-zero distortion 4.3mm lens. That lens mm means we need to push the camera out a little further than other cameras with fisheye lenses. This produces excellent footage for animator reference that looks like a properly proportioned face. What frame rate and resolution do you recommend? This is dependant on the project itself. We usually recommend shooting at the highest evenly divisible framerate of your animation timeline's fps. For example, you are working on a game and are animating in Maya at 30fps, we would recommend 60fps capture. If you are animating in Motion Builder at 29.97 for television delivery, we would recommend 59.94fps. We sell cameras that run at either 24/25/30/50/60 fps or 23.976/29.97/59.94 fps. Here is the full list supported by our cameras: If you are unsure, we recommend 720p 60 or 59.94 fps as our general best practice. It is a great balance between file size and detail. Are the cameras infrared? They are not. For better animator reference and to better work with our tracking algorithms, we use color video in our cameras. What is actually being recorded? The Mark IV records color HD video recorded with Prores or DNxHD compression in a .MOV file. Does the Mark IV system record audio? How do I integrate my audio? Our Mark IV headcams do not come with a built-in microphone, but audio can be embedded in the face video by connecting an audio feed to the audio inputs on the back of the AJA Ki Pro Rack. The Ki Pro decks have Line or Mic level XLR ana puts or AES digital audio inputs. In PCAP scenarios, most audio engineers prefer to attach microphones to the helmet itself or on the boom arm that holds our camera and then run the cable in our cable wrap and then down to the belt, where they can clip the transmitter. Then the receiver can be then fed into the mixer and then fed to the Ki Pro, or even directly plugged into the Ki Pro. In a VO booth scenario, all that's needed is to take the feed from your audio engineers board and send a signal to the Ki Pro. Does the Mark IV work with timecode? Yes, it does. We combine the video with the TC and audio at the AJA Ki Pro Rack when it is recorded. The Ki Pro Rack has an LTC input (and loop-through output) that any external timecode source (a timecode generator or Sync HD Pro Tools box) can plug into. The timecode data is recorded into the metadata of the MOV as a timecode track. How many actors can I capture simultaneously? You can capture up to 5 actors wirelessly. For wired setups, there's no limit unless you are limited by the number of digital video recorders that you own. Any number of Ki Pro recording decks can be controlled from a single interface. Timecode and audio can be daisy-chained from deck to deck to assure all the components stay in sync and identical. What is the range of your wireless system? We use the Teradek Bolt 500 system for wireless video. The working range for each unit is 500 feet (150 meters) between the transmitter and receiver. Are you compatible with Vicon, Xsens, Optitrack, Perception Neuron, Motion Analysis, Rokoko, or Qualysis mocap systems? Yes, all of them. Integrating the systems is simply a matter of attaching markers or sensors to an actor's helmet and positioning the performance capture belt in a place it doesn't occlude or interfere with the body data. For deeper integration, our Shepherd software package can take file name and start/stop triggers from Vicon, Optitrack, and Xsens systems to automatically and accurately control the recording functionality of the Mark IV system. Can you attach markers to the helmet? Yes, markers can be placed anywhere on the helmet. We include some Velcro loop medallions in the kit to place markers anywhere you need on the helmet. Does your system include a warranty? Yes, our system includes a one-year end-to-end warranty that covers every single part and component. The warranty ensures that any part or component will replace or be repaired at no additional cost, including roundtrip shipping from our Austin repair facility. How long does it take to receive my order? Depending on our order queue most systems ship within 7-10 business days. If needed sooner, please contact us. As soon as your order is placed, our operations manager will be in touch with shipping timelines. What is the 6GHz band supported by the Bolt 6 that comes with Mark IV Dual Band edition? Many devices, such as wifi routers and cell phones, use the 5Ghz frequency to communicate wirelessly, making it a very crowded space where interference can occur. This can lead to video drop outs for 5Ghz wireless video systems. The Bolt 6 uses the newly opened 6Ghz wireless frequency which is a significantly quieter wireless environment. It can also use the 5Ghz bands for backwards compatibility. In 6GHz Mode, Bolt 6 users will access faster connections and less interference for a better wireless experience. 6GHz frequency is now available in the US and Canada under UNII-5 government specifications. More countries will open the 6GHz frequency in 2023. Check here for the latest updates on which regions allow 6Ghz operation. What happens if I buy a Mark IV Dual Band system and 6Ghz is not supported in my region? In keeping with international laws and regulations, any Mark IV Dual Band system that is intended to be used in a region where the Bolt 6 is not certified to use 6GHz bands will have the firmware on the Bolt 6 set to operate in 5Ghz bands only. When regulations change and the Bolt 6 becomes certified to use 6Ghz bands, you can easily update the firmware on the Bolt 6 to enable 6Ghz bands.

    "Autodesk Maya, 3DS Max, and MotionBuilder Plug-In Apply motion data from Analyzer directly onto your rig Clean curve data that is easier for users to work with Python, Maxscript, and MEL commands create automated workflows General Workflow for Retargeter 5.0 Before you can begin creating facial animation you'll need go through the quick and simple Character Setup process. This will be done once per character and typically takes between 10 and 30 minutes to complete. The result of this process is the character setup file, an XML file used when opening a performance in Retargeter. Character setup in Retargeter is a two part process. The first part involves adding your rig controls into your character setup xml so that the software knows what controls go with each part of the face. This allows the software to apply the animation to the correct places on your rig and in the way that you dictate. This article details this first part of the process. The second part, creating an Expression Set, adds user created poses for use with the AutoSolve functionality and has its own article: Expression Set Walkthrough. Note that Expression Sets are only necessary to create if you are using AutoSolve. The subtleties and nuances of a facial performance can make or break an animation. For purposes of creating animation of the highest quality and for adding artistic decisions to the animation process, we have Retargeter. The first step in retargeting a shot is to open a performance via the Performance menu. In the Open Performance dialog box, you will be asked to select several files: Performance File (.fwr) - In the Performance File field, select the .fwr performance file that you generated during parameterization in Analyzer that you wish to animate from. This file contains the tracking data that Retargeter uses. Character Setup File (.xml) - In the Character Setup field, select the character setup xml file that you created for this character during the Character Setup phase. For more information on Character Setup, please see the following article: Character Setup Walkthrough. Shared Pose Database (Optional) (.fwsp) - The 'Shared Pose Database File' is an optional file that can be used to load \"pre-made\" poses for your character. This file is usually created by a supervisor and contains artistically approved poses for each of the character's 'Pose Groups' (mouth, eyes, brows). Please see Shared Poses for more information. From here you have a variety of options to choose from, including: Import Video, Import Audio, Set Playback Range, Set Frame Rate and Generate AutoSolve. In Retargeter, the first section at the top shows you your Pose Groups. Pose groups are containers that hold the poses for each respective group. For example, the eyebrow poses would be placed in the eyebrow pose group, the mouth poses in the mouth group, and so forth. These groups are based off of the 'Rig Groups' that have been defined for your character rig and each one has a number of the rig's controls in it. These groups are typically set to: Mouth, Eyes, Brows, Head. Poses are an essential part of animating with Retargeter. Much like creating Training Frames in Analyzer, the user decides where the most extreme and distinct facial shapes are occurring and poses the character appropriately on the given frame. These poses are then used in Retargeter's calculation to apply animation to the entire shot, usually referred to as \"retargeting.\" If you're unhappy with the results you can adjust your poses, add more, delete some, or make an infinite number of tweaks and check your updated results in near realtime by Retargeting/AutoSolving again. Retargeting is the process through which animation is generated on your rig. It uses the data from any created poses or from the AutoSolve calculations (assuming AutoSolve is on) to create keyframes on the controls that were added in Character Setup. From there, the user can manually edit the keyframes like with any animation or they can add/modify poses and retarget again to improve the animation broadly. To retarget animation onto the rig: Once you are satisfied with the poses you have created, select the pose group you wish to retarget in the Pose Group window. Click the \"Retarget\" button on the bottom of the Retargeter plugin. Retargeter will then work for a few moments to create the keyframes. Scrub through the timeline or play the animation to view the results. You can continue to add poses and retarget as many times as you like to get the desired animation. Feel free to delete poses if they are not in an ideal position or are hurting your results. Simply select the pose and hit the Delete button on the right side of the Retargeter plugin. Features of Retargeter 5.0 Apply human emotion to any digital character Retargeter is a high quality facial animation and solving software that uses machine learning and deep learning to retarget facial motion from a tracked video onto a 3D Character. Setup and use any character rig Say goodbye to complex rig requirements. The quality of your character is still extremely important but with Retargeter you have flexibility in how you build it. Retargeter can set keys on any keyable attribute; allowing you to work with bones, joints, blendshapes, morph targets, custom deformers, etc. Once you set these attributes in character setup, you are ready to create amazing, realistic animations.

Much like creating Training Frames in Analyzer, the user decides where the most extreme and distinct facial shapes are occurring and poses the character appropriately on the given frame. These poses are then used in Retargeter's calculation to apply animation to the entire shot. If you're unhappy with the results you can adjust your poses, add more, delete some, or make an infinite number of tweaks and check your updated results in near realtime. The first and most useful option for creating poses is using the Auto-Pose feature. This feature makes suggestions as to what video frame the user should create poses on based on Retargeter examining the tracking data from Analyzer and figuring out where the most significant shapes are occurring. It acts as a guide, telling the user the ideal places to create poses. Have several animators working on one character? Utilizing the Shared Pose Database functionality of Retargeter, you can store any pose you create for use with future shots, or for use with other animators. This saves time because, instead of creating new poses every time you animate a shot, you can import the already created poses, Retargeter from the Shared Pose database directly or have the Auto Pose feature use your shared pose library to automatically pose your character on the suggested frame. I've got a metric ass-ton of animation to create. Since Retargeter is a plugin to the Autodesk 3D animation apps, batch scripting capabilities are based in running commands in the native scripting language of the host application. In Maya the batch scripting commands can be run in MEL or Python, in 3DS Max they can be run in Maxscript. Create rapid workflows for semi or fully-automated results. Visit the Knowledgebase for a list of Maya Retargeter MEL Commands. Retargeter integrates with the Autodesk tools you animate in currently. Getting started with Retargeter Explore the many free resources to help you learn Retargeter. Commonly asked questions about the Retargeter workflow and best practices for use in productions. What type of rig can Retargeter work with? From a technical standpoint Faceware can work with any type of rig. Joints, blendshapes, and all custom deformers can be driven and animated by our software as long as they can be keyframed. However, from a creative and artistic standpoint the layout and setup of animation controllers can have a large impact on the quality of animation that can be produced with Faceware. What Autodesk versions do you currently support? We generally support the same versions of Maya, 3DS Max, and MotionBuilder that Autodesk maintains support on—most commonly is the previous 4 years of releases. We currently support the 2018-2024 versions of each package. How much can I animate in a day? Every project varies, but we've seen most production-ready users achieving several minutes of animation in a day. If you further take advantage of the volume-producing features such as shared poses or batch automation, volume SIGNIFICANTLY increases—we've heard producers churn through 45,000 seconds of animation within a few weeks. As a rule of thumb, if you are not at least 3 times faster than keyframe animation contact us—through training we can ensure you achieve this minimum with our best practices. Do I need to be connected to the internet to use Retargeter? For the Studio Plus version of Retargeter, no internet connection is required. For Studio, Trial, and PLE versions, an active internet connection is only required during the initial credential check whenever the software is launched. During the actual tracking process, no internet connection is required. Request your 30-day free trial of Retargeter 5.0"
