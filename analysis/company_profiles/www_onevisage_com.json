OneVisage has developed a comprehensive suite of strong authentication Software Development Kits (SDKs) that fits in any MFA solutions, independently of any hardware or platform. Premier Face SDK for Windows 10/Linux Seamless User-Experience on any e-Kiosks, Payment Terminals, Laptops Premier Face SDK for Windows 10/Linux is a software kit that enables any electronic kiosks, payment terminals, ATMs, laptops, personal computers, Point of Sales and access gates equipped with a 3D/depth camera with 3D facial biometry. To validate a payment, physical or logical access, End-User just needs to look at the 3D camera less than a second to get authenticated with a bank-grade security level. The kit can be combined with other authentication factors or technologies such as QR-code or mobile device ultrasonic proximity detection to bring 2 FA or higher. The kit can be configured in client mode or server mode while being 100% GDPR compliant and has been designed to deliver premium resilience to any picture, video or 3D silicon mask presentation attacks to protect any mid-high-value transactions or valuable assets. Key Benefits + Simple & Fast authentication + High accuracy: up to 1 error in 10'000 + Spoof-proof to Photo, Video or 3D Silicon Mask + Windows 10, Linux + Standard 3D camera: Orbbec, Intel … + Client mode (FIDO UAF style) or Server mode Premier Face SDK for Mobile Enabling 3D Facial Biometry on Billion Devices Premier Face is a software kit that turns any mobile device – smartphone, tablet, laptop, PC – or even embedded system equipped with a regular 2D/RGB or depth camera into a universal Face ID. To authenticate, the End-User just makes a short video selfie without any imposed gestures/movements. The kit uses best-in-class machine learning algorithms developed in partnership with leading computer vision universities, ETH Zurich and University of Basel, and has been designed to deliver high-precision performances and total data privacy to secure mid-high-value transactions. Key Benefits + Simple & Fast authentication + High accuracy: up to 1 error in 10'000 + Spoof-proof to Photo, Video or 3D Silicon Mask + Android 6.0+, iOS 11.0+ + Client mode (FIDO UAF style) or Server mode Premier Secret SDK Eliminating Passwords, Pin-codes and OTPs Premier Secret is a software kit that performs 3D graphical authentication and totally eliminates passwords or pin-codes on any platform (Android, iOS or HTML browser). To authenticate, the End-User simply selects one or few secret objects/figures in a 3D virtual world. The kit introduces for the first time the concepts of gamification and long-memory recall. Thanks to three-dimensional worlds, it proposes thousands of combinations for 1 secret, enabling high digital entropy equivalent to long passwords by only using 2 or 3 secret objects.
