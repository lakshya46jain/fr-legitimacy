No longer able to rely on investment income to balance disappointing outcomes, the industry is now looking to new technologies to save the day. But, improving your underwriting processes is not a once and done project. There are a lot of moving parts to consider, new data will continue to accumulate, and hence processes need to be monitored and optimised on an ongoing basis.

Financial institutions need the velocity necessary to keep up and meet the needs of their customers by creating the differentiated experiences they demand. In a world where things can change with little or no warning, speed matters.

Finance leaders seeking to drive functional improvements benefit from adopting a holistic approach that enables their teams to intelligently automate and orchestrate multiple targeted end-to-end processes with hyperautomation. By combining advanced technologies, hyperautomation optimizes core financial processes like expense reports reviews, new accounting standards compliance and invoice processing, and scales throughout finance areas including record-to-report and lead-to-cash. Join ABBYY and Incture for an advance view of new generation hyperautomation solutions pre-packaged for F&A processes and document skills built on the SAP Business Technology Platform.

In this session, we discuss the benefits of Digital Intelligence, including: Gaining a deeper understanding of customers, staff, and the overall health of the business Leveraging automation technologies to reduce costs, increase impact, and serve customers in an easy and intuitive way Simplifying processes to reduce redundancy, inefficiency, and frustration in employees' daily experiences Watch now July 21, 2021 11 a.m. – 12 p.m. CEST ABBYY Expert Talk in German with KPMG: With Automation from Traditional to Digital Corporate Structures Despite the economic downturn, the pandemic has further increased the urgency of making investments in Digital Transformation technologies.

Join us November 12th to and see live demos of FlexiCapture SDK. Speaker: Larysa Lotoska Watch now November 11, 2020 10:00AM PDT Getting digital insurance right starts with content Digital Transformation has changed not only how insurers focus on customer experience, but these changes have brought the problem of content – documents, messages, text – to the forefront of problems to tackle. But documents and unstructured content need to be handled differently than in the past. Today, content is no longer just data to be extracted by simple OCR technologies delivered by IT but rather as important information for underwriting policies, adjudicating claims and protecting against fraud and crime. It's important to understand that content provides insight and gives decision-making ability to scaling your knowledge workers and that they need new, more intelligent approaches to processing and gaining insight from it. AI with Machine Learning are capabilities that can enhance both customer experience and effective execution by helping to understand, gain insights and make decisions at the point in the process where it is needed. Getting digital right in insurance means understanding your content as living in customer experience and critical processes and using intelligent solutions enable its effectiveness as a core capability. - Underwriting, claims and reinsurance processes run on documents containing both contextual information and data for making decisions - Artificial intelligence and machine learning are changing the way you understand and use content to make these processes work better - Process Intelligence - discovering, analyzing, monitoring and alerting around processes - gets you to digitization faster than simply investing into automation Speaker: Reggie Twigg, Director, Product Marketing, ABBYY Watch now November 10, 2020 1:00 pm GMT | 2:00 pm CET ABBYY Expert Talks The New Realities of Supply Chain Risks in a Post COVID Economic Climate The first wave of digital disruption enabled brands to sell directly to online consumers — and even allowed manufacturers to engage directly with industrial customers. But many existing supply chains lack transparency and resilience and have proved brittle in the face of increasing customer expectations, disruptions, and new levels of trade uncertainty. Watch this webinar to learn: • How European companies digitize manual and paper-intensive processes to accelerate and scale their response to fluctuations in demand and supply. • What challenges are associated with gaining visibility into supply chain exposures. • Insights into Forrester's latest research on European companies' plans to reconfigure supply chains for greater responsiveness and resilience in the face of global supply chain disruptions. Watch now October 27, 2020 Digital Transformation and PDF – why OCR is not only for capturing paper documents - In the modern office there are not only paper documents and digital-born editable PDFs, but a lot of documents which are digitalized - but at the same time not or only partly accessible. - In today's mixed workflows OCR can be of great help – especially ABBYY's renowned OCR and background recognition which lie at the core of FineReader PDF - But OCR is not only for scans – a lot of PDF functionality in FineReader is actually enabled by OCR In this on-demand webinar, you will learn about FineReader PDF's capabilities featuring ABBYY's AI-based OCR technology and the role OCR plays in achieving effective work with PDFs and facilitating digital transformation.
