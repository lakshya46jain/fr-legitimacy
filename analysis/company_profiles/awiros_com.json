These metrics are leveraged by stores, manufacturers and marketers to measure conversion rate of products, increase revenue and make better sales forecasting. Increased Revenue Awiros monitors shoppers preferences closely and gives an accurate picture of hot-zones in the store, over different time scales. This information helps in deciding end-cap locations and product placement to boost the sales of most favorable and profitable products. Improved Sales Forecasting With the growth of omni-channel retail and increasing retail competition, shoppers tend to explore their options before making a final purchase. Number of shopper visits and dwell time helps in forecasting and planning for overall sales for a product. Insightful Metrics Awiros provides a number of actionable metrics at a fine-granularity to help stores and manufacturers gather feedback on \"Pricing, Packaging and Placement\" of their products.

Data Collection with Sensors Awiros uses a combination of different sensors like motion, IR and Sonar to observe shoppers, and most of the data is extracted from the footage from CCTV cameras typically already installed in stores. We make use of proprietory technology that intelligently coalesces data from different sources to localize a shopper inside a store in with a high degree of precision. Analytics and Visualization Awiros' sensors generate a tremendous amount of data that contains a variety of parameters such as footfalls overtime with respect to each product, dwell time at each shelf and the overall movement pattern and occupancy in a store. Our analytics tools process this data to create visual insights such as a heatmap of the store showing regions of the store with maximum footfall, maximum dwell time and/or bottlenecks in shopper movement. Insights and Recommendations The data visualising tools of Awiros provide a great deal of information in compact and succint infographics, which is leveraged by our clients in various ways. Morevoer, our analytics team periodically provides actionable insights and recommendations that helps our clients to maximize the footfalls inside the store, improve the product conversion rate, and significantly improve the overall shopper experience inside a store.
