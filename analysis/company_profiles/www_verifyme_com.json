(LLTI:OTCBB), a provider of identity verification and product and brand authentication, company that authenticates products and people, today announced a new version of its VerifyMeâ\"¢ Single Sign-On (SSO) app compatible with iOS 7, the latest version of the Apple® platform. The app now provides notification services that help protect against identity theft. This new version supports all of the improvements and enhancements in iOS 7 and is available for free download in the Apple iTunes Store. \"Like Apple with iOS 7 itself, we started with a desire to take something people love and make it better,†said Neil Alpert, Chief Executive Officer. \"We're proud to fully support iOS 7 and deliver improvements and new features to everyone who loves VerifyMe SSO.†VerifyMe SSO Version 1.1 is now available to replace Version 1.0. This update contains optimized compatibility with iOS 7. All VerifyMe SSO users who have saved login information within the app will have a smooth transition of their stored passwords into Apple's newest operating system. Saved login information can be stored locally on an iOS 7 compatible device, including all iPhone, iPad and iPod models. VerifyMe SSO utilizes the latest encryption techniques and a unique color swipe gesture to protect all of your most important login credentials. VerifyMe SSO has also been updated with a notification option. This option can be enabled to send the user an email or text message alert whenever repeated attempts to access the VerifyMe SSO app are unsuccessful. For instance, if someone tries to \"break in\" to your VerifyMe SSO passwords on your iPad, you will receive a text alert on your iPhone. This gives you an extra level of assurance that your passwords are only accessed by you with your unique swipe and color pattern. \"We are constantly innovating to stay ahead of those who seek to harm consumers,†said Michael R. Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board. \"Our new notification option will further protect our users' online identities as we prepare to release an even more enhanced and secure version of our app in the near future.†To download the VerifyMe app visit: http://applestore.com/verifymesso ABOUT LASERLOCK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The system authenticates human subjects using three independent factors simultaneously, creating a simple user experience and a higher degree of security than currently available on the market. This technology is especially useful for securing player identity on internet gaming platforms. The system incorporates three factors of authentication: a color gesture swipe (something you know), a smartphone or tablet (something you have) and facial recognition (something you are), already hallmarks of LaserLock's VerifyMe TM platform. This system is unique in that the color gesture swipe and biometric scan are performed simultaneously: when the user inputs the color gesture swipe into their device, the front-facing camera of the device performs a facial recognition scan simultaneously. The security of the system is enhanced when, during the facial scan, the camera also detects the direction the users eyes are moving in. This prevents an imposter from fooling the facial recognition software by holding up a picture or a pre-recorded video of the person they are attempting to impersonate. \"As authentication technology moves away from passwords and PINs, LaserLock is staying ahead of the curve with this state-of-the-art authentications system,†said Neil Alpert, Chief Executive Officer. \"This technology takes advantage of our existing biometric capabilities, including state-of-the-art facial recognition, and can easily incorporate additional capabilities such as fingerprint and retinal scans.†The technology has a variety of applications, and is an easy alternative to traditional passwords and PINs. Companies incorporating the VerifyMe TM platform into their sign-on process offer their customers a vastly higher level of security and make it simpler to to their user accounts by not having to remember long, complex passwords. \"We believe this is game-changing technology for existing and future internet gaming platforms,†said Michael R. Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board. \"We are continuing to roll out products that are safer and easier than the outdated system of passwords and PINs, and that is good news for consumers and companies providing other online services.†The Company expects this new technology to have wide popularity in the financial services industry, online gambling platforms and any login system that is susceptible to password hacking. LaserLock Technologies Successfully Completes Testing of Online Gaming Authentication Solution and Prepares for Product Launch WASHINGTON, D.C., Tuesday, July 23rd, 2013 – LaserLock Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB:LLTI), a global leader in providing state-of-the-art authentication solutions to governments, health care providers, high-end retailers and the gaming industry announced today it has successfully completed exhaustive testing of its online gaming authentication solution and is ready to take it to market. The solution is a multi-factor authentication system that utilizes the LaserLock's VerifyMe TM and other technologies to determine the identity of online gaming players. Multi-factor authentication goes beyond the currently compromised system of passwords and PINs and provides added layers of protection to everyone involved in gambling transactions. \"As more states legalize online gaming, we are excited to bring our solution to market to protect both players and casinos from the risks of identity theft,†said Neil Alpert, CEO of LaserLock Technologies. \"Incorporating multiple layers of authentication is key to making online gaming secure, and our solution accomplishes this and is quick and easy to use.†The commercial-ready solution is an application that can be integrated into online gaming platforms and uses a variety of LaserLock's VerifyMe TM and other technologies. The solution is based on three critical authentication factors: something you know, something you are and something you have. This mitigates many of the risks that come with a single method of authentication such as a password or PIN, ranging from malicious identity theft to something as benign as a child picking up their parents' tablet and gaming. After a first-time registration that authenticates a person's real identity, a player will then input a unique, color-based gesture swipe (something you know) while the app simultaneously performs a facial recognition scan (something you are) and a mobile device-based geo-location tag (something you have) – crucial to ensuring one is in a jurisdiction where gaming is legal. It also incorporates proprietary ethical gaming safeguards that mimic a physical casino's ability to identify and prevent problem gaming. It allows players to set limits for themselves and tracks patterns of play for irregularities. \"There is significant hesitation on the part of lawmakers and the public to legalize online gaming, fearing it will open up a Pandora's box of problems,†said Michael R. Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board. \"When our commercial-ready solution is utilized, in conjunction with our strong ethical gaming platform, it creates a more secure and acceptable alternative for both the player and the casino.†The Company is currently in talks with multiple online casino operators to implement its solution as the preferred method for authenticating players. LaserLock Technologies Moves Forward With An Even More Secure Multi-Factor Internet/Mobile Login System WASHINGTON, D.C. July 17, 2013 – LaserLock Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB:LLTI), a global leader in providing state-of-the-art authentication solutions to governments, health care providers, high-end retailers and the gaming industry is preparing for the expansion of its VerifyMe TM brand. The Company launched its free password wallet app in March, 2013, that allows users to securely store their passwords to the most popular web platforms and access them only with a color-based gesture swipe stored uniquely on their mobile device. This allows users to create lengthy, complex passwords without having to remember them, making their online presence more secure. The Company is planning the launch of two new VerifyMe TM products in the coming months. The first is a more advanced, paid app that incorporates cutting-edge facial recognition technology to further secure users' login information, with a launch planned for September, 2013. This multi-factor authentication technology requires something you know, something you are and something you have in order to authenticate an individual's identity. When a user puts in their gesture swipe (something they know) the API will simultaneously perform a biometric scan (something they are) and a geo-location tag (something they have), resulting in a rapid and secure authentication. \"LaserLock is excited to launch this new phase of our VerifyMe TM brand,†said Neil Alpert, CEO of LaserLock Technologies. \"We are sure that VerifyMe TM is a powerful, secure and simple to use alternative to traditional passwords – which are no longer the best way to protects one's online identity.†The second VerfyMe TM product is aimed at web developers by offering a more secure sign-on technology than traditional passwords or alternative sign-on methods. VerifyMe TM incorporates geo-location into the login process, providing individual users with a higher level of authentication and corporate users with a much more secure form of identification. \"We believe that VerifyMe TM has a huge potential to change the way people protect their identities on the Internet and on their mobile devices,†said Michael R. Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board. \"Its strong, multi-factor authentication and its simple use make it the ideal technology to replace the currently compromised system of usernames and passwords.†The current version of the free VerifyMe TM app for iPhone, iPad and iPod can be downloaded at the Apple Store. LaserLock Technologies Announces Identity Authentication Solution for Internet Gaming WASHINGTON – June 4, 2013 – LaserLock Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB:LLTI), a global leader in providing state-of-the-art authentication solutions to governments, health care providers, high-end retailers and the gaming industry announced today it has developed a solution that authenticates players of Internet gaming platforms. Since Internet gaming became legal in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware this February with other states expected to follow, companies are now faced with the challenge of establishing virtual identity verification processes to enforce underage restrictions and other ethical gaming issues. LaserLock's advanced authentication features, such as geo-location tracking and biometric facial recognition via webcam, ensures strict adherence to the laws dictating the allowed age and location of eligible players. \"Verifying a player's identity is a simple process in a casino, but has become a major hindrance for legislators looking to legalize Internet gambling,†said Neil Alpert, President of LaserLock Technologies. \"In an online environment, the risks for fraud increase dramatically as there are few ways to truly verify identity, age or location. LaserLock's patented technology brings Internet gaming companies a solution that lowers that risk substantially by verifying a player's identity each time they play and by providing an ethical component that protects the user.†Critical to mitigating the risk online gaming brings is the ability for companies to simply and correctly authenticate a player's identity, age and location. LaserLock has developed a solution using its VerifyMe TM platform that verifies all necessary identifying information. Once a player registers in the system for the first time, their identity, age, and location can be verified in a matter of seconds each time they play. \"This platform is one of several potential game changers for LaserLock,\" said Michael Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board. \"The future will see more states legalize online gaming and LaserLock's solution is all encompassing and ensures the security and safety of internet gaming that lawmakers, casinos and the public all demand.†LaserLock's solution goes beyond low regulatory thresholds to protect both gaming companies and players. It includes ethical gaming features that allow players and casinos to monitor for and prevent excessive gambling, which cannot be as easily prevented in the privacy of a player's home as it can be on a casino floor. The successfully tested prototype solution is currently being tested by Internet casinos worldwide and continues LaserLock's decade of leadership in gaming security LaserLock Looks to Facial Recognition for New Identity Verification System for Internet Gaming June 4, 2013 - LaserLock Technologies has developed a solution, which includes biometrics, to verify the age of players on internet gaming platforms. As internet gaming has now become legal in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, with other states expected to follow, companies are increasingly faced with the challenge of establishing virtual identity verification processes to enforce underage restrictions and other ethical gaming issues. LaserLock's system, through its VerifyMe platform, uses geo-location tracking as well as facial recognition via webcam for player verification. According to the company, this new system also includes ethical gaming features that allow players and casinos to monitor for and prevent excessive gambling. \"Verifying a player's identity is a simple process in a casino, but has become a major hindrance for legislators looking to legalize Internet gambling,†Neil Alpert , President of LaserLock Technologies said. \"In an online environment, the risks for fraud increase dramatically as there are few ways to truly verify identity, age or location.

The only way to maintain age restrictions as well as location verification on all platforms is the use of geo trackers and biometric facial recognition. The President of LaserLock Technologies, Neil Alpert, commented on the announcement, \"Verifying a player's identity is a simple process in a casino, but has become a major hindrance for legislators looking to legalize Internet gambling,\" Alpert continued to add, \"In an online environment, the risks for fraud increase dramatically as there are few ways to truly verify identity, age or location.
