The system authenticates human subjects using three independent factors simultaneously, creating a simple user experience and a higher degree of security than currently available on the market. This technology is especially useful for securing player identity on internet gaming platforms. The system incorporates three factors of authentication: a color gesture swipe (something you know), a smartphone or tablet (something you have) and facial recognition (something you are), already hallmarks of LaserLock's VerifyMe TM platform. This system is unique in that the color gesture swipe and biometric scan are performed simultaneously: when the user inputs the color gesture swipe into their device, the front-facing camera of the device performs a facial recognition scan simultaneously. The security of the system is enhanced when, during the facial scan, the camera also detects the direction the users eyes are moving in. This prevents an imposter from fooling the facial recognition software by holding up a picture or a pre-recorded video of the person they are attempting to impersonate. \"As authentication technology moves away from passwords and PINs, LaserLock is staying ahead of the curve with this state-of-the-art authentications system,†said Neil Alpert, Chief Executive Officer. \"This technology takes advantage of our existing biometric capabilities, including state-of-the-art facial recognition, and can easily incorporate additional capabilities such as fingerprint and retinal scans.†The technology has a variety of applications, and is an easy alternative to traditional passwords and PINs. Companies incorporating the VerifyMe TM platform into their sign-on process offer their customers a vastly higher level of security and make it simpler to to their user accounts by not having to remember long, complex passwords. \"We believe this is game-changing technology for existing and future internet gaming platforms,†said Michael R. Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board. \"We are continuing to roll out products that are safer and easier than the outdated system of passwords and PINs, and that is good news for consumers and companies providing other online services.†The Company expects this new technology to have wide popularity in the financial services industry, online gambling platforms and any login system that is susceptible to password hacking. LaserLock Technologies Successfully Completes Testing of Online Gaming Authentication Solution and Prepares for Product Launch WASHINGTON, D.C., Tuesday, July 23rd, 2013 – LaserLock Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB:LLTI), a global leader in providing state-of-the-art authentication solutions to governments, health care providers, high-end retailers and the gaming industry announced today it has successfully completed exhaustive testing of its online gaming authentication solution and is ready to take it to market. The solution is a multi-factor authentication system that utilizes the LaserLock's VerifyMe TM and other technologies to determine the identity of online gaming players. Multi-factor authentication goes beyond the currently compromised system of passwords and PINs and provides added layers of protection to everyone involved in gambling transactions. \"As more states legalize online gaming, we are excited to bring our solution to market to protect both players and casinos from the risks of identity theft,†said Neil Alpert, CEO of LaserLock Technologies. \"Incorporating multiple layers of authentication is key to making online gaming secure, and our solution accomplishes this and is quick and easy to use.†The commercial-ready solution is an application that can be integrated into online gaming platforms and uses a variety of LaserLock's VerifyMe TM and other technologies. The solution is based on three critical authentication factors: something you know, something you are and something you have. This mitigates many of the risks that come with a single method of authentication such as a password or PIN, ranging from malicious identity theft to something as benign as a child picking up their parents' tablet and gaming. After a first-time registration that authenticates a person's real identity, a player will then input a unique, color-based gesture swipe (something you know) while the app simultaneously performs a facial recognition scan (something you are) and a mobile device-based geo-location tag (something you have) – crucial to ensuring one is in a jurisdiction where gaming is legal. It also incorporates proprietary ethical gaming safeguards that mimic a physical casino's ability to identify and prevent problem gaming. It allows players to set limits for themselves and tracks patterns of play for irregularities. \"There is significant hesitation on the part of lawmakers and the public to legalize online gaming, fearing it will open up a Pandora's box of problems,†said Michael R. Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board. \"When our commercial-ready solution is utilized, in conjunction with our strong ethical gaming platform, it creates a more secure and acceptable alternative for both the player and the casino.†The Company is currently in talks with multiple online casino operators to implement its solution as the preferred method for authenticating players. LaserLock Technologies Moves Forward With An Even More Secure Multi-Factor Internet/Mobile Login System WASHINGTON, D.C. July 17, 2013 – LaserLock Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB:LLTI), a global leader in providing state-of-the-art authentication solutions to governments, health care providers, high-end retailers and the gaming industry is preparing for the expansion of its VerifyMe TM brand. The Company launched its free password wallet app in March, 2013, that allows users to securely store their passwords to the most popular web platforms and access them only with a color-based gesture swipe stored uniquely on their mobile device. This allows users to create lengthy, complex passwords without having to remember them, making their online presence more secure. The Company is planning the launch of two new VerifyMe TM products in the coming months. The first is a more advanced, paid app that incorporates cutting-edge facial recognition technology to further secure users' login information, with a launch planned for September, 2013. This multi-factor authentication technology requires something you know, something you are and something you have in order to authenticate an individual's identity. When a user puts in their gesture swipe (something they know) the API will simultaneously perform a biometric scan (something they are) and a geo-location tag (something they have), resulting in a rapid and secure authentication. \"LaserLock is excited to launch this new phase of our VerifyMe TM brand,†said Neil Alpert, CEO of LaserLock Technologies. \"We are sure that VerifyMe TM is a powerful, secure and simple to use alternative to traditional passwords – which are no longer the best way to protects one's online identity.†The second VerfyMe TM product is aimed at web developers by offering a more secure sign-on technology than traditional passwords or alternative sign-on methods. VerifyMe TM incorporates geo-location into the login process, providing individual users with a higher level of authentication and corporate users with a much more secure form of identification. \"We believe that VerifyMe TM has a huge potential to change the way people protect their identities on the Internet and on their mobile devices,†said Michael R. Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board. \"Its strong, multi-factor authentication and its simple use make it the ideal technology to replace the currently compromised system of usernames and passwords.†The current version of the free VerifyMe TM app for iPhone, iPad and iPod can be downloaded at the Apple Store.

    "The Growing Popularity of Multi-Factor Authentication Multi-factor authentication is becoming the new norm in online security. While the original method for securing the Internet, passwords and PINS, was ubiquitous in the last decade, it has become antiquated. Having multiple layers of security is the new standard in online login authentication. When MFA and the idea of a \"possession factor†were first brought to the marketplace, it meant that there would be significant investment needed to buy hardware tokens to be used in the authentication process. Now, as smart phones are almost completely penetrating the market in the developed world, this initial investment is not necessary. Smartphones simply become the MFA possession factor. This was the dominating trend for 2013, as companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and more began utilizing phone-based authentication solutions. Government regulations have also been another cause of the recent push for stronger authentication measures. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) requires multi-factor authentication for all Internet banking transactions. Similarly, the Department of Health & Human Services/Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) call for MFA when remotely accessing electronically protected health information, as a part of the HIPPAA regulations. The Office of Management & Budget applies this requirement to all federal information that is accessed remotely. These represent large public institutions, who wide adoption of new technologies can cause the further spread of the technology in the private sector. As more and more personal information is housed online, consumers and companies have recognized that additional security is needed for not only financial and health information, but for all private information. So where is this industry going? The answer is anywhere and everywhere. A recent study from Research and Markets shows that the global multi-factor authentication (MFA) market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19.1 percent from 2012-2016. A similar study from Markets &Markets, a consultancy, found this rate to be 17.3 percent for growth from 2012-2017. When you think of all of the information someone could find about you on your computer, a 7-letter password and your email address suddenly seem like a mediocre form of security. Implementing multiple layers of authentication wherever possible is the best way to ensure that protected information stays private. How to Secure Internet Gambling Online gambling is one of the fastest-growing entertainment industries in the United States and around the world. As states in the US continue to pass legislation permitting online gambling, joining many jurisdictions around the world, there will be increased pressure to secure these players and their account information. According to Juniper Research, wagers places on mobile devices for all forms of online gambling are expected to reach $100 billion annually by 2017. With this much money passing between players, their accounts are an obvious target for hackers looking steal personal and financial information. Multi-factor authentication provides security that combats hackers and makes accounts extremely secure. Additionally, there are regulatory challenges that a multi-factor authentication system can solve. Because of age requirements for online gambling, there needs to be a way to prevent teens from creating accounts or using their parents' accounts. When you imagine a teenager logging on to a parent's account and gambling away thousands of dollars, you realize how serious of an issue this is. Last year, an eight-year-old girl in England was playing games on her father's iPad and racked up £4,000 in charges. The biometric factors in the personal authentication process combat this to secure your credit card from any unwarranted charges. Another regulatory challenge occurs from the state-by-state nature of gambling laws. In the United States, there are only three states that have legalized online gambling, being Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. With mobile devices as a platform commonly used for online gambling, tracking the location of the player is extremely important. Most US jurisdictions still prohibit online gambling, and so when crossing a border between a state that does and a state that does not, gaming software needs to be able to automatically shut down. By incorporating geo-tagging technology into the login process, and sustaining this tracking throughout the duration of the gaming, the user is protected against breaking state laws. With so many technical challenges arising from online gambling, the secure network created by using a multi-factor authentication system is crucial to building a secure and trustworthy gaming platform. Not only protecting users from the many laws and regulations that accompany online gambling, multi-factor authentication instills a sense of security in users that allow them to enjoy themselves when they gamble online and allows regulators to know they are doing everything possible to protect the public. What is Multi-Factor Authentication and Where is it Used? Multi-factor authentication (MFA) aims to strength the verification process by combining multiple layers of security to further protect information. These layers come in the form of something you have (the possession factor), something you know (the intelligence factor), and something you are (the biometric factor). Together, these layers strength security and make your information more protected against criminals and fraudsters. Two-factor authentication techniques are widely used, such as an ATM card and PIN or having a code emailed to your phone that you input with your login information. Websites like Gmail, Facebook, Amazon, and Dropbox currently employ a two-factor authentication method such as this. While this is a step up from a password and pin, these two-factor authentication models do have holes. Dropbox, the web-based document-sharing site, experienced learned this a few months ago when the Q-CERT team found a vulnerability that allows hackers to bypass the two-factor security. An extra layer of security that utilizes the possession, intelligence, and biometric factors, however, would add a significant amount of strength that makes their network more impregnable. Today, multi-factor authentication is widely accepted in the marketplace as a more secure alternative to a password and pin, but there is still a large margin of growth available in of implementation. Because of the ubiquitous nature of smart phones, multi-factor authentication is possible for almost any industry and login format. Whether it is for banking and other financial institutions, cloud data access, or online gaming, the application of MFA offers consumers increased security for any type of personal verification. Adaption of a MFA login system by companies in every industry would add layers of defense that make an unauthorized person entering their network or account much more unlikely, thus making the personal information of their users more safe. When Passwords Get Hacked Adobe, the computer software company that creates multimedia software products found on almost every computer, announced last week that it had been the victim of a massive security breach that compromised the information of nearly three million customers. Brad Arkin, Adobe's Chief Security Officer, issued a security alert stating that \"certain information relating to 2.9 million Adobe customers, including customer names, encrypted credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and other information relating to customer orders†was stolen. Most would think that the theft of credit card information is the worst part of this security breach. But, card issuers generally protect against liability from fraudulent charges and these numbers are encrypted which makes finding a useable credit card number unlikely. The real threat comes from the other personal data that was compromised, such as personal addresses and password information. The average computer user has multiple accounts with multiple passwords, most of which are similar or even identical. In addition to passwords, the Adobe case also included the theft of answers to password prompts, such as your first street address or your mother's maiden name. This is significant because hackers can use this information to simply reset a password without, on most websites, needing any other identification tool. Within minutes they would have access to your accounts and personal information, only this time there is no encryption. This is why multi-factor authentication systems are so important. If a login requires multiple levels of authentication, such as a personalized swipe pattern, biometric recognition, like facial, and the possession of a device, the system would be far more difficult to compromise than simply using a password or PIN. If multi-factor authentication was \"standardâ€, the inevitable data breaches like the one that occurred at Adobe wouldn't put your online security and peace of mind at risk. It's Too Easy to Hack Social Media Facebook has over 1.26 billion users, 728 million of which are active on a daily basis. Facebook and other social media outlets have had a tremendous effect on the way we interact, share personal information and keep in touch with each other. We can now keep tabs on our friends even when they live on the other side of the planet, chat with parents and even grandparents, upload photos from personal trips and even collaborate with business partners on an upcoming project. Gone are the days where Facebook was merely for the young and IT savvy. As Facebook has \"grown upâ€, so have its obligations to keep our information secure and safe. Facebook has assured us that only the information we want other people to see is published on our profiles and walls. This may be true, but there is a weak point in the system: the authentication of the user. If I have someone's Facebook login, I can take control of their account, and act in their name. I have, in the virtual world at least, slipped into someone else's skin and obtained their identity. Not only do I have access to all the personal information, such as the address, phone numbers and private messages, I can also \"go out†and write messages, posts and e-mails in that person's name. How easy is this to do? Well, let's take a couple of examples: Your accounts are currently protected with personally identifiable information: your username and password, but those are secured generally with security questions. Information like your father's middle name name, your oldest sister's birthday, or what elementary school you went to are easy to come by and this is dangerous. If a criminal network is trying to gain your personal information for financial gain, then your credit could take a serious hit once your identity has been compromised. But there are other threats out there, too. How about a jilted ex-lover, who knows many of the intimate details of your life and is now set out to ruin your reputation. It would be fantastically simple. These are some reasons why multi-factor authentication systems are so important. If a login requires multiple means of authentication to verify a user, the system would be far more difficult to compromise than simply using a password or PIN. By tying a user's identity to more than one factor, VerifyMeâ\"¢ can protect the identity of over a billion users worldwide. If multi-factor authentication was a \"standard†authentication method for Facebook, then a plethora of security issues would inevitably be solved, and the online identities of millions of users and their real-world reputations would be secure.

The solution combines LaserLock Technologies' VerifyMeâ\"¢ authentication application with ABnote's TSM (Trusted Service Manager) and its NFC wallet application, resulting in a configurable mobile application that allows a consumer to easily and securely manage their healthcare network access. \"To have ABnote be a finalist for a Sesames Award is an honor and we are proud of our strong relationship with ABnote,†said Neil Alpert, Chief Executive Officer. \"This innovative solution strongly protects patient privacy in electronic healthcare record databases and it expands the scope of our relationship with ABnote to include not only our security inks, which are utilized to protect government documents around the world, but now our strong, multi-factor authentication solution VerifyMe TM as well. We are optimistic about the future of our relationship combining both physical and digital authentication solutions.†\"Unlike the networks for financial payment systems, the legacy infrastructure in today's healthcare ecosystem is still evolving into a single cohesive network that provides global healthcare record access for authorized entities. By combining the VerifyMe application with our existing wallet and TSM service we've essentially developed a staged offer for the industry that allows one card application to securely authenticate and communicate to any healthcare network†said John Ekers, ABnote's Global CIO. He added, \"We expect to see many more hybrid offers that will combine security, user authentication and innovation to advance the services that security consumers and healthcare practitioners expect, and we look forward to a continued relationship with LaserLock Technologies to see this to fruition.†The combined solution will be demonstrated in the ABnote booth in Hall 4, Aisle J, Booth 92 at the Cartes Paris Secure Connexions Event, taking place from Nov. 19 – 21 at the Paris-Nord Villepinte Exhibition Centre.

    "How to Secure Internet Gambling Online gambling is one of the fastest-growing entertainment industries in the United States and around the world. As states in the US continue to pass legislation permitting online gambling, joining many jurisdictions around the world, there will be increased pressure to secure these players and their account information. According to Juniper Research, wagers places on mobile devices for all forms of online gambling are expected to reach $100 billion annually by 2017. With this much money passing between players, their accounts are an obvious target for hackers looking steal personal and financial information. Multi-factor authentication provides security that combats hackers and makes accounts extremely secure. Additionally, there are regulatory challenges that a multi-factor authentication system can solve. Because of age requirements for online gambling, there needs to be a way to prevent teens from creating accounts or using their parents' accounts. When you imagine a teenager logging on to a parent's account and gambling away thousands of dollars, you realize how serious of an issue this is. Last year, an eight-year-old girl in England was playing games on her father's iPad and racked up £4,000 in charges. The biometric factors in the personal authentication process combat this to secure your credit card from any unwarranted charges. Another regulatory challenge occurs from the state-by-state nature of gambling laws. In the United States, there are only three states that have legalized online gambling, being Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. With mobile devices as a platform commonly used for online gambling, tracking the location of the player is extremely important. Most US jurisdictions still prohibit online gambling, and so when crossing a border between a state that does and a state that does not, gaming software needs to be able to automatically shut down. By incorporating geo-tagging technology into the login process, and sustaining this tracking throughout the duration of the gaming, the user is protected against breaking state laws. With so many technical challenges arising from online gambling, the secure network created by using a multi-factor authentication system is crucial to building a secure and trustworthy gaming platform. Not only protecting users from the many laws and regulations that accompany online gambling, multi-factor authentication instills a sense of security in users that allow them to enjoy themselves when they gamble online and allows regulators to know they are doing everything possible to protect the public.
