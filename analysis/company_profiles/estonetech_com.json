Software Software developed for your unique needs. Contact Us Products Smart. Versatile. Reliable. Engineered for durability, precision, and seamless performance across all applications. Medical Industrial Rugged EN-150 15.6\" Tablet PC for Endoscopy | EN-150 MJ-80 8″ Medical Rugged Tablet PC MD-100 10.1\" Medical Rugged Tablet PC HMI-70 7\" Industrial Control Panel HMI-1500 15.6\" Stainless Control Panel PPC-4107 7\" Industrial Panel PC UR-100N 10.1\" Rugged Tablet PC MS-100A 10.1\" Rugged Android Tablet PC MJ-60 6\" Rugged Handheld Technology Innovative. Robust. Insightful. Advanced technologies for durable, high-performance rugged and medical devices. MIL-STD-810G/H Certification Designed to withstand extreme environmental conditions, including temperature, vibration, and shock, our devices meet MIL-STD-810G/H standards, making them ideal for challenging industrial and military applications. MIL-STD-461G Certification MIL-STD-461G is part of the United States military standard (MIL-STD), officially known as \"MIL-STD-461G: Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Testing.\" This standard is established by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to guide the environmental adaptability of military equipment and systems during the design and testing phases. Waterproof and Dirt Ingress Protection With IP67 and IP68-rated designs, Estone's devices provide superior waterproofing and dirt protection, ensuring uninterrupted performance in wet, dusty, or rugged conditions. Screen Protection for Tablets and Panel PCs Equipped with strengthened glass, our tablets and panel PCs feature advanced screen protection against scratches, drops, and impacts, extending the lifespan of your device. RFID in Tablet Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is transforming industries by enabling wireless data transmission, asset tracking, and secure authentication. When integrated into rugged tablets and industrial panel PCs, RFID enhances operational efficiency, improves security, and automates workflows in sectors such as healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, and field service. Integrate CAC and Smart Card Reader into Tablet PC In an era where data security is paramount, organizations across industries—from government and healthcare to finance and IT—require robust authentication solutions to protect sensitive information. Traditional security measures like passwords are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats, making multi-factor authentication (MFA) essential. UWB Technology Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology is revolutionizing industries by delivering centimeter-level positioning accuracy, secure short-range communication, and ultra-fast data transmission. Unlike Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or GPS, UWB operates over a broad frequency spectrum with minimal power consumption and high resistance to interference.
