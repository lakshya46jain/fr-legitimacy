    "Digital Transformation with Biometric Signature Solution Fast evolving technologies transform the lifestyle of individuals and business processes of enterprises. With this transformation, where digitalization takes the leading role, more and more data and process becomes digital with an ever increasing speed. On of the first steps for digitalization is the digitalization of paper processes. Techsign Biometric Signature solution helps enterprises complete this digitalization process by digitalizing signatures and paper processes. Techsign Biometric Signature also brings along different advantages such as increased security, decreased costs and faster business processes. With Biometric Signature Technology, along with the image of the signature; can be captured. This biometric information is encoded and included in the document, and can only be opened in the case of a legal dispute. One Time Password or Pin Information about the medium (Mac, IP etc) Win by Decreasing the Costs Paper processes mean not only paper and utility costs because of printing, photocopy and scanning, but also mean maintenance costs for printers, archiving costs, transportation costs for documents and employment costs for lost human resources. These costs often sum up to surprising amounts for medium and large enterprises. Win by Employee and Time Utilization Employees have a chance to concentrate on core businesses by spending less time on burdensome processes such as archiving and receiving and sending papers. This also means better time utilization for managers. Faster processes mean saving time and becoming a more dynamic organization. Biometric signature is much more secure than traditional wet-ink signature. Whenever necessary, it can be confirmed that the document is not tampered. With biometric information and additional evidences, the document is much more convincing in a legal case. Every module of TechSign Biometric Signature solution is developed according to international standards and laws Let the World Win Too With near-zero paper consumption, enterprises will be of great help for protecting the environment by saving thousands or millions of trees. Which also means that The Biometric Signature Solution is also important for social responsibility. PAdES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures) standards, which are also used in electronic-signature laws, are used in biometric signature technology. This standards allow the documents to be signed and secured with an uniform methodology and allows for the detection of any tampering. This technology leverages on special algorithms designed for this purpose. Biometric Information and additional evidences are embedded to the document with special encoding. When compared with traditional wet-ink signature processes, it is clear that biometric signature solutions are much more reliable since they allow for much more effective prevention of frauds. This also means more secure business processes and trade. Why TechSign Biometric Signature Solution? TechSign Biometric Signature Solution ise completely developed by Techsign. We have the source code so we can offer tailored solutions that comply with customers requirements. You can use the biometric signature solution on \"Cloudâ€, \"On Premise†or with \"SDKâ€. Our Verification Algorithms are faster than our global competitors. TechSign Biometric Signature solution works independently from device model or operating system. The solution was developed by leveraging Open API principles, so it can be integrated with any system very easily. TechSign solutions are developed according to (EU) No 910/2014 numbered European Union Regulation. Biometric Signature Technology; has become a technology that can be widely used in many sectors due to its singularity, permanence, universality, acceptability and performance gains.

    "TechSign MultiFactor Authentication System (Fast Identity Online compatible) is the largest international ecosystem of standard based, interoperable authentication solutions. Better Security For Online Services Reduced Cost For Enterprise Simpler and Safer For Consumers FIDO standards are managed by the FIDO alliance, which is formed in 2012 with the vision of eliminating security problems based on weak, password-based authentication infrastructures. FIDO allows an easy and secure way of authentication, especially for online services. FIDO UAF (Universal Authentication Framework) Passwordless Authentication on Mobile Devices Passwordless Authentication on Mobile Devices The passwordless FIDO experience is provided by the UAF protocol. The user can register its device to the service by using a personal identification method such as fingerprint recognition, face recognition, voice recognition or a special PIN, according to the capability of the device and platform. UAF allows for managing the available methods centrally. After registration, the selected recognition method can be used for authentication to the service. At this point, it is completely unnecessary to enter a password again. UAF also allows for joint operation of different recognition methods, such as fingerprint and face recognition. FIDO U2F (Universal Two-Factor Authentication Framework) Two-Factor Authentication from Local Devices Two-Factor Authentication from Local Devices The Two-Factor FIDO experience is provided by the U2F protocol. Using FIDO U2F, online services can add an additional protection layer to their existing login systems. User continues using a username and password, as before. The service asks for the second factor authentication whenever necessary. This strong two-factor authentication methodology allows for using simpler passwords without compromising security. User can use the same FIDO U2F device for different services. Insert Dongle + Press Button FIDO2 U2F WebAuthn + CTAP FIDO Web Experience Using Local Devices FIDO Web Experience Using Local Devices FIDO2 Project is the collection of initiatives preparing an interoperable authentication standard for web browsers. It includes the WebAuthn protocol from W3C and the Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) from FIDO Alliance. Thus, it allows for fast and easy login to online services with authentication on local devices. Why TechSign MultiFactor Authentication System? Public/Private Key Based Security Local Biometric Authentication on Device Protection against Phishing and Man-in-the-middle attacks Lower development and maintenance cost Lower risk of data breach Increased Customer Satisfaction with better UX No need for complicated passwords Authentication with a simple gesture Same device and recognition for different services Easy and fast usage En Areas of Usage Employee, partner, supplier authentication Login to online services Remote access to desktop or mobile applications",

    "Digital Evidences for Digital World As a bigger part of business process is handled in digital platform, criteria for legality should be revisited. The biometric signature data and additional evidences in a sealed PDF document can be opened with a forensic tool and a special private key. With this software, location, pressure, speed, acceleration, pen angles can be analysed graphically and the calculated similarity score can be checked. Also this software can be used to show additional evidences (photo, voice file, video, information about the signature capture medium) which are embedded in the document. So biometric signature becomes a legally valid evidence which also helps to arrive at a conclusion faster. This software tool can be used to analyse every document signed with PAdES and ISO standards.",
    "TechSign Biometric Signature: SAFER THAN WET SIGNATURE Sign the electronical documents by hand using tablets or computer pads. Sealed Document: Real Document Security!
