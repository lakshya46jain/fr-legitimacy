    "Project Description Description Specification Support Inquiry Stand-alone POP Video Screen Up To 43-inch, Framed or Openframed Our POP video screens come in two form factors generally, open frame and framed. The open frame screen is designed for custom retail display integration so that shoppers view the active screen part only, while the framed screen is for easy setup & deployment in the field without custom fixture. Standard functions are Video Loop Only Or Loop & User Activation, they all work with retail advertising accessories like push button, motion sensor, RFID reader, retail LED lighting, etc Custom options available with housing development, playback programming, customized accessorries, etc. Available screen sizes & specifications, please refer to the below table. Description IPS Screens, Full Viewing Angle For More Ads Impression Most of our POP advertising screens employ IPS screen for better color performance and wider viewing angle. IPS Screens are widely used for Apple Products line with its superb color accuracy from all viewing angles, audience won't get much shift in colors or contract from any angle compared with TN screens, this is very important for advertising retail screen, it is not only about the correct, compelling color performance to display a brand's message, but also about how many audience would get the ads video impression, IPS LCD panels' mission is to deliver the Ads content in right color to all the audience at frontal of the screen with its full viewing angle. 1080P / 4K Video Auto Loop & Program Playback These digital pop screen advertising players support 1080P or 4K video playback. We have standard retail advertising solutions which play loop videos only after power on, as well as the interactive digital video screens which play user activated video. All the playbacks could be re-programmed based on custom requirements. Maintenance-Friendly: Frontal Tempered Glass, VESA Mount, Port Proector All our framed video screens come with frontal tempered glass for screen protection, a standard VESA mount 75mm /100mm for installation and the port cover /locker for anti-tampering purpose. Working with retail peripherals for a variety of interactivity options Our retail solutions support full line of retail peripherals like push button, motion sensor, barcode scanner, RFID reader, LED lighting, etc. for various user interactivity. We also support custom projects making our retail video screens work with the retail products to deliver a real product demonstration, for example, A Ring branded doorbell's button will trigger a demo video on the 7-inch open frame retail screen 10cm away, when the button is pressed, the LED ring will be blink just like the real Ring doorbell on the home gate.
