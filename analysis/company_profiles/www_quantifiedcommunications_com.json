    "Clinton Won Last Night's Debate, According to Communication Science Last night's debate — the first official showdown between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton — was, as the GOP candidate would say, a huge event. The only certainty, it seemed, was that anything could happen. However, there was a consensus among reporters that, in order to win the debate, each candidate would have to achieve a certain set of goals. Trump would have to reign in his infamous bombastic nature and approach the debate coolly, rationally, and substantively. Clinton, would have to ease off her traditionally calculated approach and connect with her audience in an engaging, authentic manner she has yet to achieve. In the hours following the event, pundits and pollsters analyzed each candidate's performance from countless angles, and QC was right there with them. We used our language analytics platform to identify which candidate had achieved those critical goals during the first faceoff. Read our full analysis to find out how they performed. You can also find QC's coverage of the first debate in Bloomberg Politics: Clinton Excels in Debate by Laying Traps on Trump's Temperament To find out how Quantified Communications can help ensure your company's communications are best-in-class, email us at info@quantifiedcommunications.com .

The shout-out goes to... Hubert Joly, CEO, Best Buy The Event: In his remarks at this fall's French American Chamber of Commerce gala , Mr. Joly outlines the \"Five Bs\" of leadership.
