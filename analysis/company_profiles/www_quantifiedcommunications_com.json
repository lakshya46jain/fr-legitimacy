QC's Communication Best Practices Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom The Event: Last week, Theresa May officially notified the EU of Britain's decision to withraw. In her coinciding speech to Parliament, May urged the country to strive for unity during this time of change. Best-in-Class Example of Optimism Why It's Great: Though the subject of her address was a bitterly divisive political issue, the Prime Minister delivered a hopeful message about Britain's future. Her optimism was underscored by her emphasis on inclusion and unity. Communication research has found that audiences are more likely to be persuaded if they feel personally involved in a message , and May's focus on \"we\" and \"us\" likely helped British citizens feel as though the bright future belonged not just to Parliament, but to the community as a whole. This Month in Communication Analytics You, Next Time You Take the Stage Infographic: 10 Stats You Need to Know to Give a Great Presentation >> There's plenty to keep in mind as you prepare for your next presentation.

This Month in Behavioral Analytics Monisha Perkash, CEO & Co-Founder, Lumo Wearable Technology Tells You How You're Doing, and Where You Can Improve >> When Fitbit brought wearable tech to the mainstream we were obsessed with the amount of data it could capture and report. But now, new wearable developments make it clear that consumers want more than data — they want action plans. Pia Orrenius, Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Where American Income Has Grown Most Over 25 Years >> This visualization of average income growth uses data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to show how the booms and busts of the past 25 years have impacted U.S. wages from county to county. Steve Bate, Paralympic Gold Medalist Big Data Analytics in Sports >> Once upon a time, athletes had to train in labs if they wanted more insightful data than RBIs or rushing yards.

Yaacov Cohen, CEO, Harmon.ie The Great Enterprise Productivity Debate >> With organizations employing countless apps to enhance productivity, many professionals are overwhelmed by the \"always on\" culture and the neverending flow of notifications. One tech company is using machine learning to tackle the problem. Michael Gretczko, Principal, Deloitte Is HR Data More Valuble to a Business than Financial Data? >> Humans (and the IP they produce) are the only assets at many tech-driven companies, so it's no surprise employers are eager to gather HR data. But where is the line between supporting employees and invading their privacy? Curated by Sarah Weber, Noah Zandan, and the Quantified Communications Team We'd love to hear your feedback.

    "Our Favorite Stories of Data Enhancing Lives A hand-curated newsletter from the Quantified Communications research team, bringing you the most up-to-date and fascinating insights in people, performance, behavioral, and communication analytics from the past month. QC's Communication Best Practices The Event: When Oprah Winfrey accepted the Cecil B. DeMille award at the Golden Globes earlier this month, her speech moved viewers to tears and set off a firestorm of speculation about the possibility of a 2020 presidential campaign. Why It's Great: Winfrey's speech scored in the top 4 percent or better for each of the ten characteristics we use to measure an audience's perception of a speaker based on his or her communication. Here are three notable examples: Authenticity: 97. From her language to the tone of her voice to the way she carried herself, Winfrey was her natural self on stage. She appeared to speak to the Golden Globes audience the same way she would speak to a guest on her show—or even to a good friend at a coffee shop. Coherence: 98. When speakers are as passionate about a subject as Winfrey was, they often struggle to organize their thoughts. But Winfrey's speech was well crafted and carefully organized—from the opening anecdotes to her admonition against turning a blind eye to injustice, she made it easy for the audience to follow along, which made her message even more powerful. Compelling: 99. Oprah supported her powerful message with a good mix of persuasive appeals—including vivid personal stories, historical details, and specific insights and advice—that kept her audience hanging on every word. ( For more on what makes Oprah such a great communicator, this article from Daniel Coyle has some fascinating insights. ) This Month in Communication Analytics Jamie Dimon, CEO, JP Morgan Chase What We Coached CEOs on in 2017 >> Though communication analytics and coaching are driven primarily by a speakers' goals, when we look back at the work we did in 2017, three key areas of focus stand out. N.J. Enfield, Linguist, University of Sydney The Secret Life of \"Um\" >> When the person we're talking to stops speaking, it takes us an average of just 200 milliseconds to respond. In unpacking what he calls \"The Conversation Machine,\" Enfield explains how we use conversation to coordinate joint action—and how fillers help us keep that train on its tracks. Brian Eno, Composer, Windows' Start-Up Chime (and much more) The Artistry Behind the Beeps, Dings, and Chimes that Fill Our Auditory Landscape >> From the Windows startup chime to the \"doors closing\" tones on the subway, universally recognizable sounds help us interact with technology every single day. You may never heard of earcons, but you've certainly heard them. This Month in Behavioral Analytics Takashi Niino, President & CEO, NEC Corp Tokyo 2020 Olympics Could Deploy Facial Recognition Tech on a Huge Scale >> From iPhone X to poultry distribution, facial recognition is slowly beginning to creep into our day-to-day lives. And now the Tokyo 2020 Olympics committee is looking to use it to improve security at the next summer games. Dan Ariely, Professor of Behavioral Economics, Duke University Curbing Your Data Addiction Will Help You Make Better Decisions >> Thse days, we collect an overwhelming amount of data about ourselves. But if we could identify and react to only the most useful and relevant information, we could improve the way we make decisions. Starting with a display-free bathroom scale. Adam Wolf, CEO, Arable Arable's Crop Sensors Give Farmers a Data-Driven Edge >> The idea of farming brings to mind old-fashioned images of hard manual labor and low-tech (or no-tech) systems. But the IoT is penetrating that industry, too, and Arable's crop sensors give farmers in-depth insights into the health of their crops. This Month in People Analytics Janis Moore Campbell, Director of Graduate Professional Development, Fox School of Business This US B-School is Launching an Artificial Intelligence Interview Feedback Tool for MBA Students >> Automated feedback provides the unbiased feedback professionals need to improve the way they communicate. We're thrilled to partner with Temple University to use our platform to support MBA students as they prepare for job interviews this Spring. Deloitte's Bersin Identifies Key Talent Acquisition Practices That Contribute to Organizations' High Performance >> With all the new, tech-driven strategies for recruiting and retaining talent, it's easy for even the savviest HR professional to become overwhelmed. But Bersin's new report identifies six key strategies that support critical HR-related outcomes. Lori Goler, Head of People, Facebook Why People Really Quit Their Jobs >> When the Facebook People Analytics team crunched their employee engagement data, they learned three important things about the employees who stayed at the company the longest —and about how to retain their most promising talent.

    "Our Favorite Stories of Data Enhancing Lives A hand-curated newsletter from the Quantified Communications research team, bringing you the most up-to-date and fascinating insights in people, behavioral, and communication analytics from the past month. QC's Communication Best Practices David Baron, Journalist and Eclipse Chaser Best-in-Class Example of Compelling Communication Why It's Great: The first time David Baron saw a full solar eclipse, it changed his life. And when he told that story on the TEDx stage, he didn't just tell it; he stepped back into the memory in a way that enabled the audience to experience it with him. It's one thing to tell a fascinating story, but Baron's ability to really embody it—through the passion in his voice, the expressions on his face, the minute details he recalled about the experience, and the fervent call to action he left with viewers—made his TEDx talk truly compelling and (hopefully) convinced his audience to seek out the next eclipse! This Month in Communication Analytics Briar Goldberg, Executive Communication Expert Talking About Innovation? Two Pitfalls to Avoid >> Everywhere we turn, there's news of another new technology that could change our lives in ways we've never imagined. So how can the leaders behind these innovations ensure their products stand out among the noise? Christian Fisch, Professor of Management, Trier University How Trump's Twitter Personality Compares with 105 Business Leaders', According to Data Scientists >> Before the election in October, researchers compared President Trump's twitter feed to more than 100 prominent business leaders to measure his Big 5 personality traits, and while the study was limited, the results are fascinating. Iyad Rahwan, Associate Professor, MIT Media Lab An Algorithm Knows When You're Being Sarcastic on Twitter >> In a new effort to identify and supress hate speech online, MIT researchers have developed an algorithm that's more adept at spotting sarcasm, and emotional subtext in general, than most humans. And they trained it using emoji. This Month in Behavioral Analytics Adam Grant, Author, Originals Differences Between Men and Women are Vastly Exaggerated >> In response to the Silicon Valley engineer's now-infamous anti-diversity memo, Wharton professor and author Adam Grant dove into the real data on gender differences. His conclusion: \"If men are from Mars, it looks like women are, too.\" Yisong Yue, Machine Learning Professor, Caltech This Facial Recognition System from Disney Tracks How You're Enjoying a Movie >> A neural network from Disney and Caltech uses 16 million data points from a theater audience's faces to read moment-by-moment reactions to a film. The creators hope this system will have broader applications, such as crowd security or healthcare. Hamish Grierson, CEO, Thriva An At-Home Blood Test is Trying to Open the Floodgates to the Coveted \"Quantified Self\" >> A London-based startup offers in-home blood tests to help users quickly and accurately uncover their health data. And, in case you're thinking this is just another Theranos, Thriva is using authenticated and accredited partners and equipment. This Month in People Analytics Sangeet Chowfla, CEO, Graduate Management Admission Council The Most Important Skill to Build into Your Talent Pipeline >> Studies from Bloomberg and GMAC have shown that, when hiring or promoting employees, the number one skill employers look for is communication. So how can you make sure your organization's bench is stacked with great communicators?
