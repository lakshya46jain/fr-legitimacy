MIAXIS SM-91M is equipped with FIPS 140-2 level 3 secure processor to provide FTM (Foundational Trust Module) capabilities. FTM provides enhanced security by digitally signing the device identity and encrypting and digitally signing biometric data in all the authentication transactions. FTM keys will be provisioned securely during the production chain, and FTM certificate details are burned to OTP memory before the device ships out from the factory. SM-91M is FBI-PIV, and Mobile ID FAP20 certified single optical authentication fingerprint scanner. It's a compact and portable fingerprint collection device for easy integration of new or existing applications with MIAXIS proprietary Justouch® NIST MINEX III approved algorithm. Powered by USB 2.0/3.0 and supports Windows, Linux, and Android operating systems. In addition, MOSIP had invited biometric device and \"Foundational Trust Module†providers to submit their devices as compliant with MOSIP, in a self-compliance exercise based on Secure Biometric Interface Specification 2.0. MOSIP is looking forward to taking a further step toward building an interconnected digital environment to enhance its platform as a Digital Public Good. MOSIP is planning to create a marketplace to list MOSIP complaint products and technology solutions.",

Powered by USB 2.0/3.0 and supports Windows, Linux and Android operating systems In partnership with NPrime Technologies (www.nprime.in) that provides MOSIP compliant SBI2.0 service, Management Server and secure FTM provisioning server, Miaxis enables MOSIP authentication applications to capture biometrics securely on Windows and Android hosts. MOSIP had invited biometric device and \"Foundational Trust Module†providers to submit their devices as compliant with MOSIP, in a self-compliance exercise based on the Secure Biometric Interface Specifications 2.0. MOSIP or the Modular Open Source Identity Platform is a global digital public good that countries and other ID issuing organizations can adapt and customize to develop a foundational ID system. It empowers user organizations to remain in control of the process of conceptualization, development, and maintenance of critical digital infrastructure such as national ID systems. For instance, Philippines Statistics Authority has a MOU with IIIT-Bangalore for the adoption of MOSIP in the implementation of PhilSys, a foundational national ID system for all citizens of the Philippines and qualified resident aliens."
