StoneLock ® Gateway Installation Manual: Detailed walk through of the setup, connectivity and use of the StoneLock Gateway. This video provides a walkthrough of the enrollment process when using the StoneLock Gateway web client. Once user data is brought in to the StoneLock Gateway from the 3rd party access control platform these users are fully managed in the web client. User data is paired and encrypted with their biometric data and then distributed to each StoneLock reader based on the access that was defined by the 3rd party access control system. StoneLock ® Pro integration configuration diagram: This diagram provides an overview of how StoneLock® Pro sits in an enterprise level access control system. Additional details can be found in the respective integration manuals under the resources page. StoneLock® Pro Integrated Features StoneLock's integrations allow you to manage all of the biometric templates and push them to the doors the person has access to in a very simple user friendly interface. Person's only need to be enrolled once to gain access to all of the appropriate units.

StoneLock's proprietary algorithms collect unique biometric data from a user's face to create each unique biometric template. The biometric data collected is dynamic based upon population analysis. StoneLock technology uses near-infrared wavelengths that are safe, invisible to the eye and allow for reflectivity measurement of features below the skin in order to generate unique biometric metadata for each user. StoneLock technology is proven to distinguish between identical twins and multiple expressions on an individual user's face. All of this happens independent of ambient light and without the use of photos, ensuring the correct person is gaining access even in total darkness.

This is achieved through near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths which are safe, invisible to the eye, and relatively unaffected by ambient light or temperature. NIR penetrates biological tissue almost 7x visible light, allowing for sub dermal spectroscopic measurements ideal for capturing intrinsic properties (shape, reflectivity, expression) while minimizing unfavorable extrinsic factors. StoneLock® Pro's near infrared technology is able to overcome the inconsistencies of visible light, and is ideally suited to create a safe, passive user experience. A subject, once detected, is matched to their unique biometric template, and in less than a second, StoneLock® confirms or denies a match within it's database. StoneLock® Pro's facial recognition technology is proven to produce an FAR better than 1/250,000.

As government moves beyond personal identity verification (PIV) cards and PIN numbers, which can easily be stolen and shared, biometrics provide reliability, convenience and total cost of ownership in one. Yet, not all biometrics are designed equally nor ensure privacy and accuracy in one solution. StoneLock's offerings provide secure authentication of identity without the use of images or personal identifiable information (PII), limiting liability for government and protecting sensitive employee information. StoneLock's facial recognition solution, StoneLock Pro, is unlike others in that is does not take a picture or live video of a face to match against stored templates in a database. StoneLock is the only facial recognition company in the security industry that uses Near Infrared (NIR) technology for biometric security because they overcome variations of visible light. There is no known way to imitate or spoof a NIR facial image, ensuring that only registered users are granted access. Protecting government's most critical assets requires multi-layered levels of security. StoneLock hardens access control to meet the most stringent requirements while offering a fast, accurate and secure solution. The threat of espionage and national security concerns have grown substantially in recent years, prompting increased attention to insider threats. StoneLock's Near-Infrared (NIR) technology makes it impossible to imitate (and thereby spoof) a person's identity. Identities are frequently stolen and exploited by those relying simply on fingerprints or photo-based biometric systems. StoneLock offers frictionless and reliable verification of identity while never storing PII about employees, ensuring the protection of privacy. A seasoned professional with over 20-years of business, manufacturing and technology experience, CEO Colleen Dunlap has driven StoneLock to be the leader in bringing new, innovative and quality products to market. StoneLock is headquartered in a Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zone just outside of Kansas City. The team is proud of their Kansas roots. StoneLock's high-quality access control products are certified for integration with the leading security platforms, representing more than 80% of the market, and hold UL certifications."
