    "LIFE ON THE EDGE™ Now trading under ticker symbols BZAI and BZAIW This new phase marks a significant milestone for Blaize as it continues to develop its transformative computing solution that integrates silicon and software to optimize AI from the edge to the core. Watch Video Introducing Uncompromised AI Edge Computing Realize the awesome potential of AI with the new Blaize ® Pathfinder® and Blaize ® Xplorer ® AI Edge Platforms that are more efficient, more flexible, more accurate and more cost effective. Now you can deploy AI on the edge without sacrifice. Watch Demos Built for AI Workloads We've only scratched the surface of an AI world. If you want AI applications that run across edge devices, operate at low power and touch millions, or that scale economically in data centers, don't look to hardware platforms and software tools of the past. You need a new approach that doesn't quickly run up against barriers of energy, cost and complexity. THE BLAIZE ® GRAPH STREAMING PROCESSOR (GSP ® ) architecture is powerful, energy efficient and adaptable to overcome the limits on computing that keep AI, machine learning and deep learning from doing all it can do. Our graph-native AI Software Suite is equally radical, simplifying and speeding deployment of your breakthrough AI applications, from the data center to the edge of everywhere. Introducing Blaize ® AI Studio Unleash uncoded The first open and code-free software platform to span the complete edge AI operational workflow from idea to deployed app. AI Studio dramatically reduces edge AI application deployment complexity, time and cost, breaking the MLOps and app development barriers to edge AI deployments.
