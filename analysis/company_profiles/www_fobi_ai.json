Keeping Clients Coming Back Having seen significant growth to their client base and service offerings, Van Isle Beauty Co. was in search of an easy-to-use platform that delivered a seamless customer experience as a part of their new membership and loyalty program, Van Isle Beauty Club. With the goal to provide feel-good experiences that encourage clients to regularly return to the salon, and collecting rewards when they do, Fobi's digital loyalty solution seemed well-fit for the job. Securing a much-coveted exclusive agreement with InLei Canada, an Italian manufacturer of lash and brow products, it was critical that the new solution not only increased Van Isle Beauty's customer retention and engagement, but also achieved greater adoption and awareness for Inlei's services as well. \"In a salon, the most important thing is to make our customers feel special and familiar with our estheticians, services, and products.
