    "Technologies AI for Humanity Knowledge Hub Whitepapers Newsletter Videos Press Articles Books Event-and-Webinar Zero incremental cost makes 2016 a very good year In 2016 more customers chose iOmniscient around the world. The tally in 2016 is shown in the graph. In addition there were many smaller projects for retail, building management and general security. This has increased the number of countries we operate in to 45 . Customers are under tremendous budget constraints and they all want the best system at minimal cost. We were able to meet this requirement through using our technology to reduce the entire infrastructure cost and enhance operational efficiency. For customers the most important factor was the fact that using iOmniscient's smart compression technology they found it was less expensive to implement an intelligent system than a recording or standard surveillance system. The feedback from these customers highlighted 4 other important factors that influenced them to partner with iOmniscient. 1. Fewer Cameras Needed: For applications like Face Recognition the iOmniscient system requires 5 times fewer cameras and hence much less infrastructure. This is because the iOmniscient system can recognize people in a crowd at 5 times the distance of any other system. With the ability to recognize 75 faces at the same time on a 1 megapixel camera the result is fewer cameras, less bandwidth and computation, less installation and lower ongoing costs 2. Reduced Response Times: iOmniscient offers solutions for customers' specific use cases. The automated response system can eliminate many steps in their processes reducing response times to incidents by 80%. Manual operations are greatly reduced also by around 80%. 3. Reliability: all iOmniscient products are armed with an Artificial Intelligence based Nuisance Alarm Minimization System (NAMS). In several competitive situations NAMS has enabled the iOmniscient system to operate with a ratio of 1:200 (iOmniscient false alarms: false alarms from the alternative system). Fewer false alarms are important for making the system effective. 4. Comprehensive capabilities: Not only is the portfolio of applications very broad but iOmniscient has a focus on being best in class in every category. Customers also have an easy upgrade path from simple products to more sophisticated ones just by changing the license key. Dell & iOmniscient jointly launch the Intelligent IoT Gateway At the Intersec Exhibition in Dubai, DELL and iOmniscient will launch their Intelligent IoT Gateway which will then be available from both companies. As the world moves to IoT, data has to be collected from multiple sensors (eg video, sound and smell). This data must be analysed and unstood. While the Gateway can trigger an :Autonomous Response\" based on the information it extracts from the data, this information can also be sent to a central location where it can be analysed further. The Dell-iOmniscient Intelligent IoT Gateway is designed to fulfil this function. The Dell-IOmniscient Intelligent IoT Gateway is rugged devide that can accept and analyse information from video, sound and smell data (very much like a human can). It can operate in the snow field of Alaska Alaska (-30°C) or the deserts of Saudi Arabia (+70°C). It can withstand vibrations, I note that you also require much less storage. rain, snow and dust storms. It can connect to any IP camera, any microphone and to specialized smell sensors.

    "iOmniscient is the technology leader in Video Analytics with an unmatched capability in analyzing realistic, complex and crowded spaces using its internationally patented technologies such as Non-motion Detection that are not available from anyone else. 2019-05-30 Read More iOmniscient provides the most comprehensive suite of Detection, Recognition and Automated Surveillance and Response Systems, from simple intrusion and counting systems to unique object detection in a crowd, multi-lingual License Plate Recognition & the worlds first non-cooperative Face Recognition for crowded scenes. Several of its capabilities (including the ability to perform abandoned object and theft detection and the ability to perform detection and recognition simultaneously on the same camera) are internationally patented. 2019-05-30 Read More All iOmniscient systems are armed with its Artificial Intelligence based Nuisance Alarm Minimization System (NAMS) to help eliminate false alarms while maintaining detection accuracy. With its extensive industry experience, the company has also developed over 30 unique industry solutions. 2019-05-30 Read More To implement a successful Smart City system one has to follow a 4 step process as follows: 1. Select the appropriate software to meet the objectives of the Smart City surveillance system. 2. Select the cameras and other hardware infrastructure. 3. Select the Systems Integrator. 4. Implement the system with appropriate camera placement and test the outcome to ensure the objectives are met. 2019-05-30 Read More iOmniscients Face Recognition System can operate in an uncontrolled environment requiring only 22 pixels between the eyes to perform recognition. The system can cope with variations in pose and expression, head gear, spectacles and facial hair. The system is not designed as a biometric access control system. Rather its primary use is in surveillance. With its ability to match faces against multiple large database, the system provides a far higher accuracy than the alternative in such situations which is a manual system. 2019-05-29 Read More In addition to matching faces against multiple lists of people it can be used to track a person. If person A has been seen on a particular camera and tagged, the system can determine which other cameras A has appeared on and when. This is perhaps the only automated technique available today for tracking people on non-overlapping cameras. In addition to detecting and tracking potential criminals, it could also be used to find lost children at a crowded event. The system can be used for customer service, to see how long it takes a particular person go travel from Point A to Point B. 2019-05-29 Read More The most powerful new technology introduced by iOmniscient within the last 12 months is the worlds first Face Recognition in a crowd. Using relatively low resolution video (the system requires only 22 pixels between the eyes) for recognition, the system can recognize people who are non-cooperative, match them against data bases and in general provide a very useful tool for catching persons of interest. 2019-05-29 Read More The most important priority of city surveillance systems is on the people themselves. The objective is to keep people safe and prevent accidents or criminal activities. Not all activities are easy to detect. For example, it is very difficult to detect if two people are fighting as this can take many different forms. However many associated behaviors can be detected. For instance, if a person falls down as a result of a fight, this can be detected. If a person begins to run suddenly this too can be detected. If crowds gather suddenly, this could be a symptom of some unusual activity as well. 2019-05-29 Read More iOmniscient remains unique for the following reasons: 1. It has the most comprehensive applications in the surveillance industry ranging from behavior analysis to Face Recognition. 2. It is able to cope with crowded scenes which is the biggest challenge in security systems. It has international patents for this application (for object detection in a crowd and Face Recognition in a crowd) which enables the software to operate in complex environments. 3.
