    "Intelligent video analytics and computer vision Intelligent video analytics and computer vision Development and maintenance of information systems Supply, configuration, and maintenance of server and network equipment Information security and IT audit Recognition of a face and its properties Detection of facial areas in the image and parameters: gaze direction, head tilt, eye status, emotion detection, presence of a mask, glasses, or smile. Facial attributes Recognition The system can determine gender and age from the image and can accurately identify adulthood. High accuracy in recognition Recognition of a person from a facial image with high precision is confirmed by the System's algorithms applied in numerous projects in various fields. Wide application of facial recognition Facial recognition algorithms are used for access control in public places, transportation fare payment, searching for individuals (including missing children), and more. Face Detection and Tracking The system detects a face and tracks its movement across the network of surveillance cameras. Only a few frames are required for the system to identify a face during inter-camera tracking. Face Search Searching for a specific face within the system's recorded events archive takes less than 1 second. Various Search Criteria Available search criteria include movement within an area, crossing lines in a chosen direction, prolonged presence of an object in an area, transition from one area to another. State Numbers Search The system enables locating where a vehicle was recently observed and in which direction it was moving. Recognition of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Uniforms Different Types of PPE Detectors operate in real-time and allow the identification of various types of personal protective equipment (PPE): helmets, masks, protective clothing. Control of Unauthorized Uniform Wearing The system monitors the wearing of uniforms with insignia exclusively by employees by comparing the recognized individual in the uniform with internal databases of individuals, police databases, etc. Monitoring PPE Wearing Within 3 seconds, the system can recognize the presence of protective equipment and notify the user of safety rule violations. Recognition of Associations of Face and Body Facial and Body Recognition The system enables simultaneous identification of the facial area and the body area of a person in an image. Association Building The system establishes a connection between the detected face and body in the image, allowing the determination of the belongingness of the found face and body to a single individual. Wide Capabilities Establishing connections between faces and bodies detected at different time intervals. The system operates effectively in crowded areas with various positions of a person's face and body. Monitoring Crowd Gatherings The system performs people counting within frames based on silhouettes and headcounts, notifying the user when a crowd forms within 5 seconds. Activity Monitoring The system allows tracking gatherings of people based on several parameters: · By time of day and days of the week, · By locations of the gatherings. Customizable Response Threshold The ability to set the number of people, upon reaching which the System will send a notification for decision-making at the observation point. Pose Recognition during a Fight The system enables the recognition of: · Raised arms and legs, · Active movements of arms and legs, · Prolonged crossing of detection zones . Pose Recognition during a Fight Wide Range of Applications The system can be utilized to prevent fights: · on the streets, · in courtyards, · in educational institutions, at stadiums and arenas during sports and other mass events. Wide Range of Applications Recognition of Human Poses and Actions A person lying down, Hand placement on a handrail, and more. Sudden Body Position Changes Movement Tracking The technology allows tracking the movements of people on the ground using a network of video cameras without facial identification. Synchronization and Accuracy Determining people's locations with up to 96% accuracy in real-time and visualizing processed data. Blind Spots Reidentification technology enables finding a person even after they enter a blind spot and appear on another surveillance camera. Identified Attributes During tracking, the System identifies the following attributes: gender, clothing color, headwear, sleeve length, presence of a backpack. Wide Range of Capabilities The system recognizes vehicle state numbers, vehicle types, colors, make, and model. Functionality expansion is possible through neural network retraining. Wide Range of Capabilities Various State Number Types The system recognizes vehicle state numbers from over 20 countries, including Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, EU countries, CIS, etc. The list is continuously updated through neural network retraining. Various State Number Types Recognition of Special Vehicles Identification of emergency service vehicles (police cars, ambulances, emergency services, etc.) Recognition of Special Vehicles Extensive List of Vehicle Brands and Models The system recognizes over 150 vehicle brands and more than 850 models. Weapon Detector Triggers upon detecting a firearm in a person's hands in the frame, identifying the \"shooter's pose.\" Use Case Scenario The primary use case scenario is public safety (streets, offices, educational institutions, etc.). The system will detect the weapon and send a notification to the operator for response and assistance.
