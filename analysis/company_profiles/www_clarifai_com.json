    "Convolutional Neural Networks in practice Convolutional neural networks are hierarchical machine learning models which learn a complex representation of images using vast amounts of data. They are inspired by the human visual system and learn multiple layers of transformations, which extract a progressively more sophisticated representation of the input. Convolutional Neural Networks in practice Convolutional neural networks are hierarchical machine learning models which learn a complex representation of images using vast amounts of data. They are inspired by the human visual system and learn multiple layers of transformations, which extract a progressively more sophisticated representation of the input. Benefits of the deep learning approach Scalable Deep neural networks scale to billions of parameters giving them capacity to learn highly complex concepts and thousands of categories. With modern hardware and abundance of data we are able to train larger and more powerful networks. Fast A trained model stores its knowledge compactly in learned parameters, making it easy to deploy in any environment. There is no need to store any additional data to make predictions for new inputs. This means that we can easily use them on embedded devices and provide responses in milliseconds. Flexible Unlike traditional computer vision approaches, our models learn to extract discriminative features from the input using the provided training data, instead of using hand-engineered feature extractors like SIFT and LBP. This makes them easy to adapt to problems in any domain.
