    "FAQs Q. What will it cost to join PharmacyID? A. To join PharmacyID now, there is no cost. After this period there may be joining fees, dependent upon the number of pharmacies in your area Q. How much do I get paid to confirm 100 point check for a National Police History Check (NPHC)? A. Your pharmacy will be paid $6 (incl GST) for each NPHC approved. Payment will be made automatically on the first day of each month directly into your account. Q. What's in it for my pharmacy? A. Joining our network will create a strong and powerful identity service for consumers right across Australia. Apart from providing you with income for services that you currently provide for free, we will also be able to drive foot traffic into your pharmacy. Each year more than 3 million people have police checks completed and we want as many of these to come to their local pharmacy as possible. As available services expand throughout the network we expect more and more Australians to identify their local pharmacy as the 'go to' place for identity services. Higher levels of checks will attract higher remuneration. Q. What equipment will a pharmacy need? A. Initially, for police checks, a pharmacist will need no more equipment than they probably already have. Here is a list: Police Checks: Computer connected to the internet and a barcode scanner. You can log on without using a scanner, but it will make the process faster. Identity Cards/Proof of Age: Computer connected to the internet and a barcode scanner Web camera. Appropriate lighting and backdrop: n.b. the software has been written for PharmacyID and will be provided to Pharmacists at no cost. Passports and Visa Applications: The next round of passports will include a digital fingerprint in addition to the ICAO standard photograph. Not all pharmacists will elect to do passports, however, we estimate that if 25% of pharmacies in Australia join the PharmacyID network, we will have a larger number of outlets than the current provider. Computer connected to the internet and a barcode scanner Web camera. Appropriate lighting and backdrop. Digital fingerprint machine. PharmacyID are currently using \"touchless†technology which will take a set of fingerprints in less than a minute. The technology is called \"finger on the flyâ€. PharmacyID will also be able to provide you with passport photograph printers. You will be able to provide passport photos to individuals, independent of PharmacyID. The printer is DNP DS40 and the cost per set of four prints is approximately 20 cents per set. Q. What other services will PharmacyID provide over time? A. Building the network of active pharmacies is our priority in the first twelve months. Conducting NPHC is only the first of many applications that will generate revenue for your pharmacy. Future applications like passport and visa applications, proof of age cards, and identity verification for banks and other institutions will generate greater revenue for your pharmacy. Q. How will PharmacyID work? A. Establishing a network of pharmacies in Australia is key to building a strong and robust national service. Identity services will commence with witnessing identity documents for the purpose of completing police checks. This service requires no additional hardware and the pharmacy will only require internet access to complete the task. As the person has already paid for their check, once the pharmacy views the identity documents and ticks the relevant box, an invoice is automatically created and the pharmacy is paid for all checks done in a monthly automatic payment. As contracts are signed, more services will be provided. Some may require International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) passport standard photographs being taken. The PRM Group have the software that will take ICAO standard photographs which will be provided to you free of cost. You will need to purchase a web camera (which will be compatible with the software), lighting and a neutral background.Further biometric services such as fingerprints and voice capture will follow. Q. What remuneration does the pharmacy receive? A. We have placed the fee for a police check at $6.00 (includes GST). To take an International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard photograph in addition to the 100 point I.D. check, we envisage a payment of $10.00 (includes GST). As the level of service rises, so will the remuneration. As an example: we estimate that future payments for passport applications may be around $25.00 and greater for higher level checks. Q. What are Identity services? A. Identity services can be as simple as witnessing a person's original documents and signing a photocopy to say that it is identical with the original. These types of documents are usually drivers licence's, passports, photographs etc., and are currently being used by government authorities and commercial organisations to identify people. Q. How many NPHC'S will we do in the first twelve months? A. This will be dependent on the local population and your location. We expect basic 100 point ID verification for Police Checks to build over time and for consumers to identify with their local pharmacy for these and other types of services. Q. How do I access the PharmacyID system? A. All you need is a computer/POS with active internet. Q. Who can conduct identity checks in my pharmacy? A. Any trusted employee who has completed the training can conduct identity verification. Q. Do I need training? A. Yes, training is hosted on the PharmacyID website. Q. What sort of training do I need to complete? A. Training is online and video based. The first application is to verify 100 points identity for National Police History Checks. Watch the video, answer a few questions and you are ready to verify a police check. It's that easy! Q. Will I need a user name and password to access the system? A. Yes, we will issue unique user names and password to access the system. Q. Is there a support line or help desk for PharmacyID? A. Yes, PharmacyID has a team of consultants who are trained and experienced in all facets of identity verification. Our 1300 YES ITS ME (1300 937 487) number is the central contact for all enquiries. We can also be contacted at info@pharmacyID.com.au Q. What happens if a customer does not have 100 points of identification? A. If a customer does not have enough points to confirm identity we cannot complete the transaction. During the application process they will be informed of what they need to take to the pharmacy. Q. Can the pharmacy create an application or account for a customer? A. No. The system is user driven and all customers must create an account and pay for the service online before attending the pharmacy. Q. Can the pharmacy change an existing user application or account? A. No. Only the customer or PharmacyID consultants can alter/modify their account. Q. How does PharmacyID manage privacy? A. Information we receive about individuals will never be disclosed to any other organisation, company etc., for any purpose counter to the individuals privacy. This is due to, in some instances, legislation. For instance, you are not permitted by law to disclose information about people in regard to police checks they have submitted. Additionally, the directors of PharmacyID are adamant about maintaining people's privacy and security. Over 120 organisations in Victoria alone use your driver's licence as a form of identity, and they often photocopy the licence. Every time you permit someone to copy your driver's licence you are potentially giving away your identity. PharmacyID are serious about maintaining people's privacy, unlike organisations that sell your information to companies overseas. PharmacyID will never sell, give away, permit access to, any information about Pharmacists, or PharmacyID clients to anyone, unless provided for by the law. n.b. You will see privacy items mentioned in your contract. Q. Will I need to complete training for each new service that is introduced? A. Training for each new service will only be required if new identity functions are needed. The identity verification system will always have the same look and feel. As services are added, the system will be enhanced with additional function boxes that will prompt new activity. e.g. proof of identity card: Identity verification is the same but new training will be required on how to take an ICAO standard photograph. Q. Does the Pharmacy Guild of Australia know about this project? A. Yes, PharmacyID has met with the PGA who are supportive of any opportunity to increase the value of the pharmacy network and help pharmacies diversify their businesses and remain profitable. Q. Will PharmacyID be at APP in 2015? A. Yes PharmacyID will be at stand 336 at APP in 2015. Q. Who are PharmacyID partners? A. Some of PharmacyID partners are: Sagem/Morpho: Touchless fingerprintmachines, RMIT: Testing and development of Biometric Security etc, AB Note: AB Note currently produce most of the drivers licences, MasterCard's, Visa cards etc., Australia wide, and they are keen to assist PharmacyID in providing high level security identity cards for universities, schools, hospitals, commercial organisations and emergency management organisations such as the CFA and SES.

The DVS helps organisations build greater confidence in the identities of their clients. This helps protect governments, businesses and Australians from identity crime. How the DVS works The Document Verification Service (DVS) confirms the details on an evidence of identity document match records held by the government authority issuer. The DVS checks if the details are still valid. The DVS does not: Make a decision on a person's identity Provide access to an issuer's database Verify the authenticity of physical documents Verify identities of clients presenting those documents Verify documents for individuals—only approved organisations can use the DVS. Within seconds , the DVS can validate documents and credentials issued by Australian Government, State and Territory government agencies. Verifiable Documents The following Australian evidence of identity credentials can be matched through the DVS: Birth certificates* Centrelink concession Cards Certificates of registration by descent Change of name certificates* Citizenship certificates Driver licences ImmiCards Marriage certificates* Medicare cards Passports Visas * These documents will be available for matching by both government and non-government users for jurisdictions as they come online. Please refer to Addendum 2 of the Business User for document availability. The Matching Process The DVS matching process involves a user, gateway service provider, issuer and the DVS hub: User — an organisation authorised to use the DVS to match identifying information. Gateway Service Provider — an organisation authorised to direct information match requests to and from the DVS Hub on behalf of approved users. ( i. e. PharmacyID ) Issuer — an organisation that issues the identifying information (also known as the official record holder). DVS Hub — a technical router that securely directs requests between users and issuers.
