    "FAQs Q. What will it cost to join PharmacyID? A. To join PharmacyID now, there is no cost. After this period there may be joining fees, dependent upon the number of pharmacies in your area Q. How much do I get paid to confirm 100 point check for a National Police History Check (NPHC)? A. Your pharmacy will be paid $6 (incl GST) for each NPHC approved. Payment will be made automatically on the first day of each month directly into your account. Q. What's in it for my pharmacy? A. Joining our network will create a strong and powerful identity service for consumers right across Australia. Apart from providing you with income for services that you currently provide for free, we will also be able to drive foot traffic into your pharmacy. Each year more than 3 million people have police checks completed and we want as many of these to come to their local pharmacy as possible. As available services expand throughout the network we expect more and more Australians to identify their local pharmacy as the 'go to' place for identity services. Higher levels of checks will attract higher remuneration. Q. What equipment will a pharmacy need? A. Initially, for police checks, a pharmacist will need no more equipment than they probably already have. Here is a list: Police Checks: Computer connected to the internet and a barcode scanner. You can log on without using a scanner, but it will make the process faster. Identity Cards/Proof of Age: Computer connected to the internet and a barcode scanner Web camera. Appropriate lighting and backdrop: n.b. the software has been written for PharmacyID and will be provided to Pharmacists at no cost. Passports and Visa Applications: The next round of passports will include a digital fingerprint in addition to the ICAO standard photograph. Not all pharmacists will elect to do passports, however, we estimate that if 25% of pharmacies in Australia join the PharmacyID network, we will have a larger number of outlets than the current provider. Computer connected to the internet and a barcode scanner Web camera. Appropriate lighting and backdrop. Digital fingerprint machine. PharmacyID are currently using \"touchless†technology which will take a set of fingerprints in less than a minute. The technology is called \"finger on the flyâ€. PharmacyID will also be able to provide you with passport photograph printers. You will be able to provide passport photos to individuals, independent of PharmacyID. The printer is DNP DS40 and the cost per set of four prints is approximately 20 cents per set. Q. What other services will PharmacyID provide over time? A. Building the network of active pharmacies is our priority in the first twelve months. Conducting NPHC is only the first of many applications that will generate revenue for your pharmacy. Future applications like passport and visa applications, proof of age cards, and identity verification for banks and other institutions will generate greater revenue for your pharmacy. Q. How will PharmacyID work? A. Establishing a network of pharmacies in Australia is key to building a strong and robust national service. Identity services will commence with witnessing identity documents for the purpose of completing police checks. This service requires no additional hardware and the pharmacy will only require internet access to complete the task. As the person has already paid for their check, once the pharmacy views the identity documents and ticks the relevant box, an invoice is automatically created and the pharmacy is paid for all checks done in a monthly automatic payment. As contracts are signed, more services will be provided. Some may require International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) passport standard photographs being taken. The PRM Group have the software that will take ICAO standard photographs which will be provided to you free of cost. You will need to purchase a web camera (which will be compatible with the software), lighting and a neutral background.Further biometric services such as fingerprints and voice capture will follow. Q. What remuneration does the pharmacy receive? A. We have placed the fee for a police check at $6.00 (includes GST). To take an International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard photograph in addition to the 100 point I.D. check, we envisage a payment of $10.00 (includes GST). As the level of service rises, so will the remuneration. As an example: we estimate that future payments for passport applications may be around $25.00 and greater for higher level checks. Q. What are Identity services? A. Identity services can be as simple as witnessing a person's original documents and signing a photocopy to say that it is identical with the original. These types of documents are usually drivers licence's, passports, photographs etc., and are currently being used by government authorities and commercial organisations to identify people. Q. How many NPHC'S will we do in the first twelve months? A. This will be dependent on the local population and your location. We expect basic 100 point ID verification for Police Checks to build over time and for consumers to identify with their local pharmacy for these and other types of services. Q. How do I access the PharmacyID system? A. All you need is a computer/POS with active internet. Q. Who can conduct identity checks in my pharmacy? A. Any trusted employee who has completed the training can conduct identity verification. Q. Do I need training? A. Yes, training is hosted on the PharmacyID website. Q. What sort of training do I need to complete? A. Training is online and video based. The first application is to verify 100 points identity for National Police History Checks. Watch the video, answer a few questions and you are ready to verify a police check. It's that easy! Q. Will I need a user name and password to access the system? A. Yes, we will issue unique user names and password to access the system. Q. Is there a support line or help desk for PharmacyID? A. Yes, PharmacyID has a team of consultants who are trained and experienced in all facets of identity verification. Our 1300 YES ITS ME (1300 937 487) number is the central contact for all enquiries. We can also be contacted at info@pharmacyID.com.au Q. What happens if a customer does not have 100 points of identification? A. If a customer does not have enough points to confirm identity we cannot complete the transaction. During the application process they will be informed of what they need to take to the pharmacy. Q. Can the pharmacy create an application or account for a customer? A. No. The system is user driven and all customers must create an account and pay for the service online before attending the pharmacy. Q. Can the pharmacy change an existing user application or account? A. No. Only the customer or PharmacyID consultants can alter/modify their account. Q. How does PharmacyID manage privacy? A. Information we receive about individuals will never be disclosed to any other organisation, company etc., for any purpose counter to the individuals privacy. This is due to, in some instances, legislation. For instance, you are not permitted by law to disclose information about people in regard to police checks they have submitted. Additionally, the directors of PharmacyID are adamant about maintaining people's privacy and security. Over 120 organisations in Victoria alone use your driver's licence as a form of identity, and they often photocopy the licence. Every time you permit someone to copy your driver's licence you are potentially giving away your identity. PharmacyID are serious about maintaining people's privacy, unlike organisations that sell your information to companies overseas. PharmacyID will never sell, give away, permit access to, any information about Pharmacists, or PharmacyID clients to anyone, unless provided for by the law. n.b. You will see privacy items mentioned in your contract. Q. Will I need to complete training for each new service that is introduced? A. Training for each new service will only be required if new identity functions are needed. The identity verification system will always have the same look and feel. As services are added, the system will be enhanced with additional function boxes that will prompt new activity. e.g. proof of identity card: Identity verification is the same but new training will be required on how to take an ICAO standard photograph. Q. Does the Pharmacy Guild of Australia know about this project? A. Yes, PharmacyID has met with the PGA who are supportive of any opportunity to increase the value of the pharmacy network and help pharmacies diversify their businesses and remain profitable. Q. Will PharmacyID be at APP in 2015? A. Yes PharmacyID will be at stand 336 at APP in 2015. Q. Who are PharmacyID partners? A. Some of PharmacyID partners are: Sagem/Morpho: Touchless fingerprintmachines, RMIT: Testing and development of Biometric Security etc, AB Note: AB Note currently produce most of the drivers licences, MasterCard's, Visa cards etc., Australia wide, and they are keen to assist PharmacyID in providing high level security identity cards for universities, schools, hospitals, commercial organisations and emergency management organisations such as the CFA and SES. Imagus Technology: Facial recognition, VedaleonTechnologies: Airline booking systems and self-service solutions, Auraya Systems Pty Ltd: Voice recognition, iP Edge: Web development and systems... ...and many, many more.

    "PharmacyID provides Australian Government, business and consumers with a more efficient, secure and trusted identity service through their local community pharmacy. Identity verification has become a standard requirement in the set up of personal accounts with service providers on and offline.

    "Verification of Identity (via PharmacyID) PharmacyID is a network of pharmacies throughout Australia that perform Verification of Identity (VoI) functions, much as they have done for the past 150 years, but with the addition of digital functionality, making their VoI more secure, efficient and traceable. Geoff Stockton, a retired Victoria Police Inspector, set up PharmacyID. Geoff formed the Personnel Risk Management Group (The PRM Group) in 1997 for the purpose of pre-employment screening. Geoff soon found that people would go to great lengths to hide their true identities, so he formed PharmacyID. Many of our processes today that require a person to identify themselves are done solely with digital processes, and these processes are subject to fraud or Identity Theft. PharmacyID fills the identity verification gap by combining the power of digital processes with a human face-to-face VoI. So, whatever application requires VoI, the digital processes are applied up to the point of having the person supply their documents of identity, in person, at a pharmacy. Once the documents, and the person, have been identified at the pharmacy, the process is complete. The whole process, from the start of the application to the VoI, is completely traceable and auditable. What make PharmacyID such a secure process? Before we talk about the attributes of PharmacyID, let's talk about some of the existing processes and why they are failing. Statutory Declarations: Statutory Declarations have been the mainstay of verifying peoples identity and documents for the past 150 years. There are lists of dozens of occupations of people who are entitled to witness Statutory Declarations. The problems are numerous. (a) seals or stamps are easily reproduced or can be purchased on the internet for as little as $16.00. If you want to replicate the stamp of a doctor, JP, solicitor, policeman, you simply need to get them to witness as real document, and then send the stamped document to a vendor on the internet and get an exact duplicate. Voila! You can now do your own certifying. Please see our \"Walter Mitty\" stamp that we purchased from the internet. (b) The person witnessing the document is not qualified to verify that the document is real. Their job is to stamp a copy of an original document and state that the copy is a true copy of the original. They are unable to state that the document is not a fake. (c) It is almost unheard of for a witnessing person (JP, doctor, solicitor) to be asked if they have witnessed a document. (d) Many documents presented to qualified persons require the qualified person to initial each page. This does not confer any security in the document and does nothing to prove its provenance. (e) Because the process is paper based, there is no audit process. Try telling if a document was properly \"witnessed\" a year after the event! Digital Processes: All processes whether it be identification of a person identity to identification of a document uses digital processes, which are all traceable and auditable. From the time a person commences and application to the time the person/document is verified we have a full audit trail of the entire process. Document Verification Service : PharmacyID is a Gateway Service Provider for the Office of Home Affairs Document Verification Service (DVS). All processes, where possible, incorporate the DVS check within the process. Ubiquitous and Trusted: Pharmacists are trusted members of the community who have the authority to witness documents and sign statutory declarations. They are located in every community in Australia, so access to a PharmacyID member is usually very convenient. Blockchain: Building blockchain into the PharmacyID processes adds a new layer of security that has never been available before. See more about blockchain applications under the heading \"Blockchain Processes\". Identity Theft: Identity Theft is rife in Australia. Some estimates say that it is costing Australians over $4 billion dollars per annum. There are several ways that Pharmacists can contribute towards helping Australians secure their identities: (a)When a person makes an application and provides identity document details, these details are confirmed at the pharmacy with the pharmacist visually checking original documents and then confirming their sighting on-line (digitally). So, the documents never have to be copied and provided to someone you don't know and whose retention and destruction processes are not provided to you. In other words, your original documents never need to leave your hands! (b)The pharmacist checks original documents, not photocopies which no longer have security features such as holograms etc., (c)The document verification is backed up by a DVS check prior to the pharmacist checking the document. (d)Inbuilt blockchain guarantees that documents and identities are secure and the owner of the documents is the gatekeeper who decides who has access to their documents. Any and all access is fully auditable in the blockchain process. (e)The face-to-face process rounds off the process to ensure that the right person is presenting the documents.
