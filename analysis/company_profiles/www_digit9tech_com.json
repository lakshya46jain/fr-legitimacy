    "Case studies Custodial Management Loss Prevention in Retail Black-list / VIP Identification Visual Hacking Solution Loss Prevention in Retail Black-list / VIP Identification DIGIT9 TECH LABS V4 RANGE With the COVID-19 virus spreading easily through touchpoints, fingerprint scanners, card readers, and different devices used for accurate identity authentication can quickly become a source for infections, specifically in public spaces. Our Solution can be used in such cases for contactless detection. Due to the Re-opening of numerous retail industries, the biometric access control devices are playing a significant role for the safety and security of the people. Our contactless biometric access control device is designed for consumers who don't want to interact with shared contact-based authentication devices. The access points with biometric contact used in public transport can be replaced by D9-V4X for contactless forehead temperature scan and mask detection. Looking into the concept of contactless guest access and authentication, When a guest arrives into a hotel, if facial recognition technology is in place, he or she can self-check-in, activate elevators, and unlock rooms through a biometric face scan. Our solutions can provide a new contact-less experience at the time of temperature scanning, mask detection, and authentication before check-in. As offices start to re-open, Contact-based Biometric systems could pose a big threat to safety from coronavirus. Our contactless biometric scanner and identifier can be integrated into the existing Access Control Systems.

Sentinel – is a comprehensive Biometric software solution which enables custodial facilities to achieve significant operational efficiencies and savings whilst contributing towards effective rehabilitation. The core of Sentinel is powered by HID biometrics for IDentification and Authentication. This platform provides enhanced visibility and security by integrating with all the existing security infrastructure and placing 'verifiable identity' at the centre of the operation. ASSETS & RESOURCES MANAGEMENT SENTINEL integrates all the procedural steps in a typical facility - for e.g., Biometrics identifies the inmates/visitors/staff – which is integrated with the Prisoner Management, Building Management System, Time Management, HR, Payroll, etc. This eliminates the need to maintain multiple records as the current procedures are largely manual or semi-automated. Sentinel provides a single window IDentification and life history of the prisoners, visitors and the correction facility staff. SENTINEL Visitor Management modules and secured Access Control enables visitor checks and on-boarding in just a few seconds. IAM module ensures strict compliances are followed even in the online registration process. This eliminates the need to maintain clerical engagements, paper work, dedicated personnel and above all, the security risk of manual intervention Sentinel provides a single window Visitor IDentification, Authorization, Privileges, Restrictions, Geo-Fencing, etc with a detailed movement trail of the visitor within the facility Assets & Resources Management Manual day-to-day management means engaging a large back-office administration workforce to handle multiple systems – payroll, rostering, asset checks, etc. SENTINEL integrates all these backoffice functions using existing modules and easy to integrate third-party plugins. Sentinel framework makes it easy to for the customers to customize the process-flow based on existing workflow. Staff engagement with the Sentinel is UI driven and easy to adopt with minimal training. Self serving Kiosks can be deployed for 24x7 unmanned operations by Visitors, Contractors, Vendors, etc. SENTINEL integrates operational procedures such as inmate transfer, inmate identification, inmate records, resources and assets transfer between facilities, etc. in easy to maintain single platform. Sentinel APIs offer seamless integration with the existing administration systems or any other third-party solutions in the network. This eliminates the need to maintain multiple records as the current procedures are usually manual and subject to duplication and human error. SENTINEL framework allows multiple Correction Centers to function in sync thus reducing the cost of maintaining multiple systems and staff.
