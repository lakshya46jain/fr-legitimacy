    "The concept of providing businesses with innovative and tailored software solutions to the challenges associated with specific enterprise needs began a few years ago, whilst developing a system for the import-export industry. The innovation became a business when Bitventure was officially registered in 2012. Bitventure was born in a time of technology disruption, change and complexity. In this exciting but challenging environment, we have embraced new technologies, approaches and methodologies to deliver high-end software solutions for organizations in both the private and public sector. We live outside the box and enjoy challenging the status quo. We've built the first real-time multi-bank Account Verification platform in South Africa, a mission-critical Payment Switch (processing over R1 billion worth of transactions every quarter), a SARS integrated import-export system and many more. Our most important asset will always be our team and we only hire the best. Our winning formula draws together the expertise of several IT experts, industry specialists and is complemented by substantial investment in training and cutting edge technology. The integration of these resources and capabilities means that we are able to provide innovative and effective tailored solutions of the highest quality at economical rates. Bitventure, with head office in Bedforview, Johannesburg, is a leading software engineering and solutions company. We have mastered the dynamics of software engineering.
