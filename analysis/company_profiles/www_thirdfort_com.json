We will store your other Personal Information only for the period of time that is necessary to conduct the relevant checks and provide the services (the Thirdfort Services) requested by your solicitor, estate agent or other adviser(the Thirdfort Client). This period is usually less than one month. As soon as we have provided the Thirdfort Services we will within 30 days delete all your information(or remove all identifiers from the information so that it no longer contains any Personal Information) other than your mobile number. If the process takes longer than usual and we hold any of your PersonalInformation (other than your mobile number) for six months from the date on which you provided the data, we will notify you and ask for your permission via the Thirdfort App to hold the information for a further six months in order to continue providing the Thirdfort Services to the Thirdfort Client.

If you do not use the Thirdfort App for a period of two years following the deletion of all your other Personal Information, we will also delete your mobile number and stop maintaining your Thirdfort Consumer Account. Local device storage feature After we have provided the Thirdfort Services to the Thirdfort Client and deleted all your data (apart from your mobile number) on our systems, the Thirdfort App automatically continues to stores the data on your mobile device. Note that the data stored on your device is not accessible by Thirdfort. This enables you to reuse this data via the Thirdfort app if you need to provide it to another solicitor, agent or other adviser in relation to a different transaction or other legal matter. In practice this means that you do not have to to rekey the data the next time you need it. In order for us to enable you to reuse your data this way we must maintain your Thirdfort Consumer Account, for which we need to retain your mobile number to use as a unique identifier or username. To access data stored on your device via the Thirdfort App you must use the same mobile number (user-ID) and device (device-ID)as when the data was originally saved. We then combine your user-ID and device-ID to create a unique encryption key which can access and upload the data stored on your device. This is a security feature to prevent someone else borrowing your mobile device and logging into another Thirdfort account via your app and thereby accessing your data. If you do not want to use this local device storage feature, you can delete your Thirdfort Consumer Account at any time. We will then stop maintaining you Thirdfort Consumer Account and within30 days permanently delete your mobile number. You can also uninstall the Thirdfort App (and delete the associated app data) to delete the data stored on your device. If we delete your mobile number and you then wish to create a new Thirdfort Consumer Account with the same mobile number, we will generate a new user-ID. We will not recognise your previous user-ID which means you will not have the unique encryption key to be able to reuse the data stored on your device.
