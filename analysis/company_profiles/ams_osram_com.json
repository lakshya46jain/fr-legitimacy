    "Vision 2021 2021/10/05 - 2021/10/07 Messepiazza 1, 70629 Stuttgart, Deutschland Stuttgart, Germany 展位号: Hall 8: Booth 8E46 活动网站: Register Now Join ams OSRAM at the world's leading trade fair for machine vision. Join ams OSRAM at the Vision 2021 Get to know the latest ams OSRAM technologies at the world's leading trade fair for machine vision . We deliver miniaturized solutions that enable machines (robots) to operate safely and efficiently​. Date: October 5, 2021 Time: 12:00 - 12:30 CET > Register Now Title: Near Infrared 3D Sensing with Active Light Sources Abstract : 3D optical systems in combination with machine learning algorithms have significant growth potential in industrial mass markets. These systems increase productivity of a factory's production system through improved safety, flexibility and autonomy. In order to bridge the gap between the analog world and its digital representation smart and powerful sensing solution are essential. Whether for use cases in areas of human machine interaction, mobile robot navigation or object detection and picking, optimized 3D vision systems with IR enhanced sensors and VCSEL illumination are the basic building blocks which fuel advanced algorithms with high quality data. We will shine light on 3D time-of-flight , stereo vision and new approaches for structured light technology.
