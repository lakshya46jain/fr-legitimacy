    "What Is Know Your Third Party?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party (KY3P or KYTP) is a due diligence process that organizations perform at the beginning of a relationship with a vendor or any other third party. The purpose of KY3P is to determine the risk of third-party relationships and implement relevant procedures to mitigate the risk. Regulations require businesses to verify the identity of a third party, analyze its activities, and access money laundering risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Risks Does a Third Party Pose?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Implementing an effective KY3P framework is not just a mere regulatory requirement. It is a widely accepted method to protect companies' interests. Lack of transparency in a business relationship can have devastating consequences. If anything goes wrong, the organization may lose clientele, profits, and the trust of its investors. Thus, it's crucial to be aware of the common risk factors third parties may present. The most common are reputational damage, non-compliance risk, and information security breaches. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Reputational Damage<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Third-party relationships can cause customer dissatisfaction and diminish your reputation due to poor security, sensitive data breaches, violations of laws, or poor service. It could have terrible consequences for your business if you start a business relationship with a vendor who has pending litigation or bankruptcy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Non-Compliance Risk<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n If a third party's product or service is inconsistent with regulatory requirements and policies, this may hurt your company too. Non-compliance may disrupt business operations and bring regulatory penalties. That's why it is important to run your third parties against PEP and sanctions registries and take appropriate risk mitigation activities if your vendor falls into these lists. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Information Security Breaches<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Often, third-party vendors need to get access to sensitive company data. To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

It is a widely accepted method to protect companies' interests. Lack of transparency in a business relationship can have devastating consequences. If anything goes wrong, the organization may lose clientele, profits, and the trust of its investors. Thus, it's crucial to be aware of the common risk factors third parties may present. The most common are reputational damage, non-compliance risk, and information security breaches. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Reputational Damage<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Third-party relationships can cause customer dissatisfaction and diminish your reputation due to poor security, sensitive data breaches, violations of laws, or poor service. It could have terrible consequences for your business if you start a business relationship with a vendor who has pending litigation or bankruptcy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Non-Compliance Risk<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n If a third party's product or service is inconsistent with regulatory requirements and policies, this may hurt your company too. Non-compliance may disrupt business operations and bring regulatory penalties. That's why it is important to run your third parties against PEP and sanctions registries and take appropriate risk mitigation activities if your vendor falls into these lists. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Information Security Breaches<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Often, third-party vendors need to get access to sensitive company data. To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations.

It is a widely accepted method to protect companies' interests. Lack of transparency in a business relationship can have devastating consequences. If anything goes wrong, the organization may lose clientele, profits, and the trust of its investors. Thus, it's crucial to be aware of the common risk factors third parties may present. The most common are reputational damage, non-compliance risk, and information security breaches. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Reputational Damage<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Third-party relationships can cause customer dissatisfaction and diminish your reputation due to poor security, sensitive data breaches, violations of laws, or poor service. It could have terrible consequences for your business if you start a business relationship with a vendor who has pending litigation or bankruptcy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Non-Compliance Risk<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n If a third party's product or service is inconsistent with regulatory requirements and policies, this may hurt your company too. Non-compliance may disrupt business operations and bring regulatory penalties. That's why it is important to run your third parties against PEP and sanctions registries and take appropriate risk mitigation activities if your vendor falls into these lists. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Information Security Breaches<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Often, third-party vendors need to get access to sensitive company data. To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

It could have terrible consequences for your business if you start a business relationship with a vendor who has pending litigation or bankruptcy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Non-Compliance Risk<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n If a third party's product or service is inconsistent with regulatory requirements and policies, this may hurt your company too. Non-compliance may disrupt business operations and bring regulatory penalties. That's why it is important to run your third parties against PEP and sanctions registries and take appropriate risk mitigation activities if your vendor falls into these lists. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Information Security Breaches<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Often, third-party vendors need to get access to sensitive company data. To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

It could have terrible consequences for your business if you start a business relationship with a vendor who has pending litigation or bankruptcy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Non-Compliance Risk<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n If a third party's product or service is inconsistent with regulatory requirements and policies, this may hurt your company too. Non-compliance may disrupt business operations and bring regulatory penalties. That's why it is important to run your third parties against PEP and sanctions registries and take appropriate risk mitigation activities if your vendor falls into these lists. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Information Security Breaches<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Often, third-party vendors need to get access to sensitive company data. To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

Non-compliance may disrupt business operations and bring regulatory penalties. That's why it is important to run your third parties against PEP and sanctions registries and take appropriate risk mitigation activities if your vendor falls into these lists. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Information Security Breaches<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Often, third-party vendors need to get access to sensitive company data. To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

Non-compliance may disrupt business operations and bring regulatory penalties. That's why it is important to run your third parties against PEP and sanctions registries and take appropriate risk mitigation activities if your vendor falls into these lists. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Information Security Breaches<\\/h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n Often, third-party vendors need to get access to sensitive company data. To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

To ensure data security, you need to assess how the vendor stores and processes the collected data. It would be best to verify whether the vendor has any third or fourth-party involved. Failing these checks can leave your data available to unauthorized parties.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n What Is the Difference between KY3P, KYC, KYB, and KYM?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KY3P is sometimes called third-party KYC or third-party due diligence. But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

But as you may be aware, there are also KYC, KYB, and KYM procedures. While these processes are very similar, their goals and level of due diligence differ. Let's take a closer look at the most important AML compliance procedures. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Customer (KYC)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> KYC has been around since the inception of anti-money laundering regulations and has become a standard practice for obligated industries. This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

This verification procedure pertains to every client an obligated industry deals with. However, it usually refers to natural persons, for example, a new customer applying for a credit card. In this case, a bank would have to verify the client's identity, perform due diligence to assess the money laundering risks, understand the source of the client's funds and evaluate its legitimacy. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Business (KYB)<\\/a>: <\\/strong>For years after KYC was established, most obligated industries were not mandated to verify business partners and clients. The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

The regulatory loophole posed significant AML risks and was fixed by mandating the KYB process. Now, obligated industries must verify the identity of a legal entity's representatives and establish an ultimate beneficial owner \\u2014 a person who directly benefits from the company's profits. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Merchant (KYM)<\\/a>:<\\/strong> If you're planning to start a relationship with a supplier rather than a client or business partner, you should implement a KYM procedure. The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

The KYM process uses best practices from both the KYC and KYB procedures since the merchants can be both natural and corporate entities. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party:<\\/strong> KY3P is a due diligence process used to assess and mitigate the risk associated with third-party vendors. It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

It is closely related to both KYB and KYM procedures and shares a similar due diligence process.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n How Does the Know Your Third Party Process Work?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Getting to the bottom of who you work with is not easy. KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

KY3P is an expensive and time-consuming process. Businesses must open compliance departments with suitable numbers of staff with up-to-date knowledge of ever-changing regulations. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are typical steps a KY3P compliance specialist should take. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Verify the identity <\\/a>of the third party. The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

The process includes business representatives and owners.<\\/li> Perform due diligence<\\/a>. During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

During this step, you need to gather business registration information, names, addresses, and other relevant information. You may also need details on the business industry, managing directors, status, and incorporation date. After collecting relevant data, you should validate its accuracy against independent, trustworthy sources, such as government registries. <\\/li> Additionally, regulations require checking PEP (politically exposed persons) and sanction lists. Adverse media screening can also help assess the vendor's reputation. <\\/li> Lastly, analyze the vendor's business model, operations, and transactions. <\\/li> When you complete the due diligence process, you will have enough data to calculate the third party's risk score. This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

This score will determine whether you need to take additional actions to mitigate risk and decide if a vendor matches your risk appetite. <\\/li> Don't forget to send the vendor security questionnaire to gather data on the business's compliance with security requirements. <\\/li> If the onboarding is successful, you need to implement ongoing monitoring. This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take. The ongoing monitoring feature will not let you miss document expiration dates or other changes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Know Your Third Party is a complex and resource-intense procedure. However, it is an important step to ensure the business's security and compliance with regulations. Implementing an effective KY3P procedure can protect a company's reputation, assets, and data security. While the process is expensive, many companies mitigate the costs by integrating a working regtech solution, such as Ondato. <\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" What Is Know Your Third Party?

This procedure involves periodic checks on any changes in the provided information. For instance, implementing ongoing adverse media checks will immediately inform you about relevant media pieces. Monitoring the vendor throughout the relationship will ensure regulatory compliance and effectively mitigate new risks as they arise. <\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n To mitigate the potential losses arising from manual processes, many companies dedicate identity verification<\\/a>, due diligence procedures, and ongoing monitoring to regtech solutions, such as Ondato. Powered by the latest technology, Ondato OS can swiftly verify and onboard vendors. Our effective solution automatically assesses the risk score of your vendors and lets you know if there are any additional actions to take.

    "Efficient Customer Experience<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process. Apparently, the more time a client spends on the application, the higher the chances that they will quit the process. The abandonment rate increases by 40% if the process takes more than 10 minutes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Companies should carefully consider the duration and complexity of their onboarding process. It's important to understand that creating a streamlined and frictionless experience that aligns with strict KYC<\\/a> regulations is key to high success rates. The best way to do it is by making the user flow as short as possible.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Ondato's identity verification tools<\\/a> are based on carefully researched and well-crafted user flows. While they depend on the regional compliance requirements, most flows require only a few steps, such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The customer takes a selfie.<\\/li> The customer captures a photo of their ID or passport.<\\/li> The process is wrapped up after the customer signs the agreement documents.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n How to Onboard Customers in Less than 90 Seconds?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Speed can make or break the onboarding process. To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

Apparently, the more time a client spends on the application, the higher the chances that they will quit the process. The abandonment rate increases by 40% if the process takes more than 10 minutes.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Companies should carefully consider the duration and complexity of their onboarding process. It's important to understand that creating a streamlined and frictionless experience that aligns with strict KYC<\\/a> regulations is key to high success rates. The best way to do it is by making the user flow as short as possible.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Ondato's identity verification tools<\\/a> are based on carefully researched and well-crafted user flows. While they depend on the regional compliance requirements, most flows require only a few steps, such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The customer takes a selfie.<\\/li> The customer captures a photo of their ID or passport.<\\/li> The process is wrapped up after the customer signs the agreement documents.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n How to Onboard Customers in Less than 90 Seconds?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Speed can make or break the onboarding process. To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

It's important to understand that creating a streamlined and frictionless experience that aligns with strict KYC<\\/a> regulations is key to high success rates. The best way to do it is by making the user flow as short as possible.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Ondato's identity verification tools<\\/a> are based on carefully researched and well-crafted user flows. While they depend on the regional compliance requirements, most flows require only a few steps, such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The customer takes a selfie.<\\/li> The customer captures a photo of their ID or passport.<\\/li> The process is wrapped up after the customer signs the agreement documents.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n How to Onboard Customers in Less than 90 Seconds?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Speed can make or break the onboarding process. To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

While they depend on the regional compliance requirements, most flows require only a few steps, such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The customer takes a selfie.<\\/li> The customer captures a photo of their ID or passport.<\\/li> The process is wrapped up after the customer signs the agreement documents.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n How to Onboard Customers in Less than 90 Seconds?<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Speed can make or break the onboarding process. To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure fast service, you can enable OCR technology to capture the client's details automatically, and they won't have to manually fill in their name, birth date, and other information. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Additionally, implementing electronic signatures to sign documents without printing or downloading them will greatly improve customer experience and make the process faster. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n The most important accelerator of KYC processes works in the background. As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

As soon as the client provides their ID, their identity is automatically checked in various registries to prevent spoofing attempts, authenticate their identity, and evaluate a person's risk score. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n It's important to think of small details that could derail the onboarding and implement solutions ahead of time. If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

If a client starts a process in a device that doesn't support camera function, implementing omnichannel technology can help quickly migrate the process to another device – without losing the progress. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n These technologies and functions allow Ondato clients, such as banks and other financial institutions, to onboard new clients in less than 90 seconds. In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

In comparison, traditional banks take around 18 minutes to onboard clients digitally. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Our focus is to provide a smooth and pleasing user experience so our users can perform their everyday tasks more efficiently,\" says Ondato UX designer Tomas Gecevi\\u010dius. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customizable KYC Procedure<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n KYC may feel like solving a puzzle \\u2013 you have to get all the pieces right. If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide.

If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide.

If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide.

If the process is cumbersome and slow, you'll lose clients right at the onboarding stage. If you miss something, you may be susceptible to hefty fines. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n A centralized solution can simplify the KYC process by allowing you to build an effective KYC strategy based on local and international requirements. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n You can customize the Ondato OS with these modules to check a customer's background: <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n IP and E-Mail Risk Scoring<\\/li> Sanctions Screening<\\/li> PEP Screening<\\/li> Negative Media Screening<\\/li> Registry Screening<\\/li> Proof Of Address<\\/li> Geolocation<\\/li> IP scoring<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n To verify documents, consider adding:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n OCR<\\/li> Spoofing Detection<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Enable biometric confirmation such as:<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Facial Verification<\\/li> Biometric Face Comparison<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you have your onboarding process ready, don't forget that compliance doesn't end with onboarding. To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work.

Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide.

To ensure that each client is in check with the latest KYB<\\/a>, KYC, AML<\\/a>, or CTF regulatory compliance requirements, you should monitor changes throughout the whole customer lifecycle. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Onboarding Clients with Safety in Mind<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n Safety has never been more important. According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide. With this in mind, we strive to provide a flexible, one-stop-shop solution to onboard customers quickly and efficiently,\" says Ondato's Product Owner Matas Bernotas. about our platform here<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\" Efficient Customer Experience According to the Digital Banking Report, the account abandonment rates correlate with the duration of the process.

According to ITRC, during the first three-quarters of 2021, businesses experiencing data breaches increased by 17%<\\/a>. You can make your clients feel confident that their sensitive data is safe by using a trustworthy third-party service. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n We use only certified third-party technologies. Ondato facial recognition technology operates a $ 100,000 Spoof Bounty Program and passes NIST Level 1 & 2 PAD testing with 0% FAR, proving that it's completely fraud-proof. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Our team of highly qualified professionals ensures the protection of our servers and information infrastructure. Our system is monitored around the clock every day. No security breach attempt slips through the cracks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, Ondato OS operates in compliance with international benchmarks. We are certified to the ISO\\/IEC 27001:2013 security standard that confirms that Ondato manages security holistically and comprehensively. We implemented efficient information security surveillance to address customer and architectural security risks. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n <\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n Final Words on Customer Onboarding<\\/h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n Customers can get frustrated when they face a process that does not work. It has been estimated that as much as 33% of US consumers<\\/a> consider switching to another company after just one bad experience. That's why organisations are losing millions during onboarding. Using trustworthy technology such as Ondato OS can increase your onboarding success rates. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n \"Ondato OS focuses on clients and their customers' experience. We aim to become an essential day-to-day tool for compliance communities worldwide.
