Testimonials Unfortunately a few months ago our offices were destroyed by hurricane sandy. Our files were lost and we were forced to move, it was horrible. One of the positives was thankfully we were using FingerCheck. All of our hours were stored in the cloud and we used the mobile app to punch from our temporary office. They even sent us a brand new clock at an unbelievably low and discounted price! Adam Gold We have a small family owned and operated store in Indiana. I am not the most computer savvy person in the world so support is very important to me. From the moment we signed up we had a dedicated rep working with me every step of the way. We couldn't be happier! Linda Turner Our employees are mainly on the road going from client to client. We would have no idea where they were and if they showed up to meetings on time. We now require them to use the FingerCheck Mobile App. The app allows them to punch in on the go. It gives us their GPS coordinates so we know they are actually there! Sam L. The FingerCheck application has made my job as the store manager a whole lot easier. I like every part of it! Jacob K. Absolutely amazing and intuitive. I've used it many times on the go. The Mobile App is amazing and has saved me so many time. I have instituted a policy that our employees are required to call me if they forgot to punch , are at another location or if they are at a meeting in the field. Instead of writing it down, I do it on the spot using the app on my Android phone . I'm thoroughly impressed and I kind of enjoy using it lol. Stuart A.
