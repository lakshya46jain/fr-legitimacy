    "What is a digital wallet? A \"digital wallet\" is a blanket term for a range of technology that helps you store payment information and make transactions digitally. A digital wallet allows you to do away with cash and physical credit cards in favor of electronic transactions and payment methods, usually relying on your phone to transmit payment data securely. Built for storing passwords, credit cards, and more, LastPass works great as a simple, secure digital wallet. It facilitates online shopping for all e-commerce websites so that your shopping experience is much faster, no matter what device you use. If you ever leave home without your wallet, you can always look up your cards in LastPass. How it works You can shop online without ever having to pull out your physical wallet. Simply to your favorite online shop using a password manager like LastPass. Then when you check out, an icon will appear that you can click to autofill your contact information – like your address and phone number – as well as your credit card number. It's just as easy when on the go. E liminate the need to type your passwords on mobile with the LastPass extensions for Safari and Chrome on iOS, and the app fill features on Android. Save even more time with the simple copy-paste shortcuts, too. Benefits of a digital wallet Do your online shopping faster thanks to automated form filling. Keep your credit cards securely stored in your LastPass digital wallet. It's safe enough for your passwords, so it can be trusted with sensitive information too. Protect your information by no longer saving your credit card numbers on various websites with unproven security. You can have both convenience and security with your LastPass digital wallet. Create multiple payment profiles to easily store and use different cards for different purposes. One could have your corporate credit card and one personal. Share credit card numbers or other information like health insurance cards with your family using LastPass Families . You no longer need to physically be in the same place to share something from your wallet. Where should I use my digital wallet? Mobile banking made easy We all know how important it is to protect our banking accounts with strong passwords. But logging in to your mobile banking apps with those strong passwords gets tedious, fast. By storing usernames and passwords in LastPass, you can quickly fill or copy-paste your credentials. Easily to payment providers If you use peer-to-peer payment sites like PayPal or Venmo, your digital wallet can store all your logins for you. No more digging for your wallet When you're checking out online, there's no more need to go find your wallet and painstakingly type in your credit card number. Creating a profile in your password manager ensures you always have your card on hand when you're ready to make a purchase. It also lets you easily check out as a guest if you'd prefer not to store your credit card with every online vendor you use. Protect your digital wallet with two-factor authentication It may be difficult to secure your physical wallet, but storing your payment information in LastPass allows you to not only protect that information with a strong master password but also two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication simply adds another login step, requiring an authentication code, fingerprint swipe, or approval notification before access is granted. How secure is my digital wallet? If you use LastPass as your digital wallet, it's very secure. With local-only encryption, your data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level. Data stored in your vault is kept secret, even from LastPass. Your master password, and the keys used to encrypt and decrypt data, are never sent to LastPass servers, and are never accessible by LastPass. We are also SOC 2 Type II compliant. This detailed review of our controls and processes is a \"gold standard\" for confirming the security and reliability of LastPass. It's safe to say that this electronic wallet is much more secure than the physical one you carry around in your pocket every day. Additional LastPass Offerings Form Autofill Automatically fill in online logins, forms, payment information, and more with LastPass autofill. Data Breach Monitoring LastPass monitors third party data breaches in one place, keeping you informed and secure.

Easily to payment providers If you use peer-to-peer payment sites like PayPal or Venmo, your digital wallet can store all your logins for you. No more digging for your wallet When you're checking out online, there's no more need to go find your wallet and painstakingly type in your credit card number. Creating a profile in your password manager ensures you always have your card on hand when you're ready to make a purchase. It also lets you easily check out as a guest if you'd prefer not to store your credit card with every online vendor you use. Protect your digital wallet with two-factor authentication It may be difficult to secure your physical wallet, but storing your payment information in LastPass allows you to not only protect that information with a strong master password but also two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication simply adds another login step, requiring an authentication code, fingerprint swipe, or approval notification before access is granted. How secure is my digital wallet? If you use LastPass as your digital wallet, it's very secure. With local-only encryption, your data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level. Data stored in your vault is kept secret, even from LastPass. Your master password, and the keys used to encrypt and decrypt data, are never sent to LastPass servers, and are never accessible by LastPass. We are also SOC 2 Type II compliant. This detailed review of our controls and processes is a \"gold standard\" for confirming the security and reliability of LastPass. It's safe to say that this electronic wallet is much more secure than the physical one you carry around in your pocket every day. Where should I use my digital wallet? Mobile banking made easy We all know how important it is to protect our banking accounts with strong passwords. But logging in to your mobile banking apps with those strong passwords gets tedious, fast. By storing usernames and passwords in LastPass, you can quickly fill or copy-paste your credentials.
