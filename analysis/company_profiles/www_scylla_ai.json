    "Team Mission At Scylla, our mission is to empower the private security industry with next-gen AI solutions. And with every new product in mind, we strive to make safety more accessible to those who could not afford it otherwise. Core values At the core of Scylla team there are four main values: D iscipline C ommunication C ooperation P artnership Team Members Albert Stepanyan CEO AND FOUNDER Hey there, I am Albert, A.K.A. Cyberhulk.

Ara Ghazaryan TECHNICAL CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF DATA SCIENTIST I hold a Ph.D. degree in Optics and Molecular Physics. Over the course of 9 years, I have been a postdoctoral researcher at Munich Technical University, Pusan National University, and National Taiwan University. Being a physics guy with a background in optics and imaging techniques, I faced the problem of image analysis very early in my career, back at National Taiwan University, where I first built and then utilized optical systems that were aimed to address various biomedical diagnostic problems. The main challenge was first to learn how to distinguish images corresponding to pathogenic tissue samples and quantify compounds based on their optical features, followed by the even more challenging task of teaching the computer to do it automatically and even better than a human would do. All this experience, later on, came in handy, developing a sophisticated computer vision-based security suite called Scylla.

    "Community case study Sterling Consulting Envigado Get a quote Overview The idea is to utilize cameras that have large scale overview on public areas for social rules violation detection enforced by COVID-19 pandemic. Cameras of UAVs, installed on helicopters as well as solid mounted on tall buildings surveying large open air areas are to be used for non-compliance detection. The corresponding alert is to be sent to relevant authorities to take preventive actions. People without facial masks (in places where face mask usage is mandatory in open air) as well as obeying social distancing rules are detected in real-time. CHALLENGE Detection of individuals who do not wear face masks. Detection of social distance violation for a group of people. Send alert with visual information on violation, time, location. Bring corresponding CCTV streams on top of the others to raise awareness of surveying personnel. OUR SOLUTION Bring corresponding CCTV streams on top of the others to raise awareness of surveying personnel. Scylla crowd management module was used to calculate social distancing. Scylla dashboard and mobile apps used to send an alert to relevant personnel. Scylla was integrated into the existing CCTV surveillance system to raise awareness by enlarging the streams where a violation has been detected to make it easier for security personnel to identify the violation and take appropriate actions. Customer Testimonial Nilson Ortiz Managing Director Sterling Consulting Colombia Your problem and Scylla's solution Within Scylla there are several types of video analytics such as: biometric facial recognition, reading and identification of vehicles through the plates, detection of the non-use of masks, social distancing and in addition to that, detection of firearms and knives. So, a person who walks through the territory without using a mask, is the system able to detect it, because in Envigado it's forbidden to stay in public spaces without the use of a mask. Is it possible? It is indeed! The system analyzes the crowds in the scene and determines the people who do not have the mask, in which case, it generates an alert that is received at the monitoring center, so appropriate measures are taken.

    "The Business Impacts of Threat Detection through Thermal and Fever Screening Get a quote Pandemic and the New World All companies and people are embarking on an uncharted journey towards a new normal together. The response to the pandemic was primarily reactive. Business leaders did not understand the impact. Organizations that have had to shutter their doors due to the pandemic are now looking at ways to protect themselves, their employees, their customers, from the new threats that are presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thermal screening is being explored as a way to detect potential virus carriers, as well as other threats affecting companies and people. How to Reopen Safely? Restarting and opening are not easy. There are new threats and safety concerns. Technology must be implemented. Airports, venues, and establishments have started to incorporate quick thermal scans of people to alleviate any concerns or possible threats from the possible spread of the virus. Thermal screening is one option that will play a key role in a safe reopening for organizations around the world. There are several symptoms of COVID-19, but an extreme and consistent fever is one known symptom of COVID-19. Company procedures are changing too. All employees, and specifically safety teams, now have added duties for their day to day activities. Their priorities are to assist in containing the spread of the virus and to help find ways to continue the operations, protect customers, and to provide consistent and safe services. This is not an easy adjustment. There are several proposed solutions and safety measures. The implementation of fever screening is core to businesses progressing in this new world. Scylla Thermal Scanner The Scylla Threat Detection AI, more specifically the Thermal Scanner System, is a technology that is becoming increasingly popular as more organizations look for ways to slow the spread of the virus. A challenge presented with thermal screening is the number of infected persons that have this symptom. An estimated 12-15% of infected COVID-19 carriers have this symptom and it does not completely eradicate the threat. You can quickly identify a person's temperature through Scylla. It is non-evasive. Scans in under one second. The solution can also be implemented to maintain social distancing measures. Before you choose to implement and employ thermal imaging systems, you should consider current and even future laws regulating technology use. First, under the Americans With Disabilities Act (and similar state laws within the US), measuring the body temperature of an employee is considered a medical examination and thus is subject to certain limitations. Along these lines, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the United States recently approved checking temperatures of employees and even suspending job offers to individuals who have a temperature in excess of 100.4 degrees. The EEOC justifies the use of such measurements now because of the \"direct threat†of COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic. The use of thermal screening and fever detection systems is not full proof, nor is it without its challenges. Some individuals may choose not to give the authorization to perform the scan. Some scanners may not provide accurate readings. Performing thermal screening can also become an additional burden on an employee doing their job....which now includes maintaining public safety. An estimated 12-15% of infected COVID-19 carriers have this symptom and it does not completely eradicate the threat The Future of Work The world has changed. Thermal screening is going to be a regular method used by companies. The pandemic is anticipated to be present for the next several quarters and maybe future years. Scylla has developed technology that can alleviate the challenges presented by having to urgently accommodate threat detection measures through thermal screening. Scylla's solutions are able to be implemented through your current thermal cameras and your regular security procedures and technology. By implementing threat detection measures utilizing Scylla's technology, you do not have to purchase handheld thermal scanners that are unverified or possibly avert the current health and safety requirements by not scanning at all. It is much easier and simplistic to detect threats such as fever screening, gun detection, threats of violence, and others through the comprehensive Scylla protection suite. The adjustments due to the pandemic, along with the ever-present previous threats, are resulting in companies having to evaluate their plan to address each challenge. Companies should begin to regularly address a full risk assessment for their business, employees, and customers and Scylla is available to assist your company move forward with its protection technology. Thermal screening is going to be a regular method used by companies for the foreseeable future.

Along these lines, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the United States recently approved checking temperatures of employees and even suspending job offers to individuals who have a temperature in excess of 100.4 degrees. The EEOC justifies the use of such measurements now because of the \"direct threat†of COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic. The use of thermal screening and fever detection systems is not full proof, nor is it without its challenges. Some individuals may choose not to give the authorization to perform the scan. Some scanners may not provide accurate readings. Performing thermal screening can also become an additional burden on an employee doing their job....which now includes maintaining public safety.
