    "Digital Twins to Enable Remote First Options for Businesses According to the recent Internet of Things (IoT) implementation survey done by Gartner, 13% of organizations implementing IoT projects already use Digital Twins, while 62% are either in the process of establishing its use or plan to do so. Digital Twins represents the convergence of the physical and the virtual world where every industrial product will get a dynamic digital representation. In a way, they are the virtual replicas of physical devices that data scientists and IT pros can use to run simulations before actual devices are built and deployed. Digital Twins help businesses in becoming Remote-First through remote commissioning and diagnostics of products that are already in the field, helping in lowering service costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Additionally, they can troubleshoot equipment in remote locations to reduce incident resolution time. Similarly, when new products are to be commissioned for clients, configuration can be performed remotely by service personnel. With Digital Twins entering the mainstream, exciting new technological developments such as remote or autonomous machine operations, automation and predictive maintenance, can be achieved. Digital Twins can act as a trainer for an AI, tirelessly repeating scenarios and generating data to learn from. It is changing how technologies such as IoT, AI and Deep Learning are optimized. In this webinar, you will learn about: This webinar on Digital Twins will touch upon various aspects of the concept. Some of the topics that will be explained in detail in the webinar includes: Digital Twins concepts, its rising prominence & applications across industries How Digital Twins help businesses in becoming Remote-First, saving costs and time Difference between regular simulator and Digital Twins How AI rewrites the possibilities of Digital Twins Deep Learning & Digital Twins Deep Learning-based Digital Twins in semiconductor manufacturing How to drive business value and sustainability with Digital Twins Live Demo and Use Cases on Digital Twins Please write to marketing@innominds.com and we will share with you the access to the portal where you can play around and experience the Digital Twins of a lithium ion battery.

    "Autonomous Testing Assures Software Quality for the Modern Era Why Autonomous Testing with Self-Healing and Self-Learning is the Future of Quality Engineering \"By the end of 2025, 30% of organizations will have implemented an autonomous automation strategy and will outperform competitors in quality and customer experience satisfaction metrics.\" -Gartner In a highly competitive business, just having a continuous testing environment may not be adequate to deliver high quality applications at the market-dictated velocity. With advances in AI, ML, analytics and intelligent automation, testing organizations are abandoning scripted testing and adopting autonomous testing to enable quality across a continuous testing pipeline with zero human intervention. Autonomous testing can be deployed across SDLC, to exponentially accelerate time-to-market ensuring both Shift Left and Shift Right paradigm, resulting in improved allocation of testing resources and reduced costs. Adding AI and ML components to testing make it possible to introduce 'self-learning', 'self-adapting', and 'self-healing' features which ensure that test scripts are automatically healed and executed without any failure, even when the UI of the application under test has changed. This automated self-healing of the test scripts enables truly touchless testing environment. Adding a layer of analytics to AI enabled QE frameworks will allow enterprises to get critical insights from test data. Therefore, shifting to AI-driven autonomous frameworks will be the future of next-generation quality engineering. Join the session by Sairam Vedam, CMO, Innominds and Sai Chintala, President, QE & DevOps, Innominds, for a deep dive into the world of AI-led autonomous testing and discover: The importance of autonomous testing and how it ensures software quality How and where to use autonomous testing to remove testing bottlenecks How to build autonomous testing capabilities The most trending testing tools and platforms including AI-driven iHarmony TM that accelerate testing 100x faster Sai has a solid expertise in building global service delivery organizations, which are spread across diverse geographies, serving Fortune 500 Enterprises, ISVs, & Startups and Unicorns.
