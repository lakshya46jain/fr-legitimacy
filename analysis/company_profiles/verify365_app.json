    "Zagreb Airport is the first in the EU to adopt Digital ID Share: News Verify 365 Zagreb Airport is the first in the EU to adopt Digital ID March 14, 2023 In the European Union, travellers travelling between Zagreb and Helsinki this summer will be the first to test a \"pilot project†aimed at digitising travel documentation. To test digital ID travel documents, specialised equipment is being placed at Helsinki and Zagreb airport border controls. On flights between the two cities, passengers will be given access to a mobile application where digital travel documents would be stored. Passengers will provide their Digital ID information through the app to the border inspection officials before they go for their trip so that the documents can be reviewed beforehand. When travellers arrive at the border checkpoint, a photo will be taken and used to link the digital ID travel documents. Once those taking the trip are at the border check, a photo will be taken, which will then be used to connect the digital travel document with the individual. Despite going through this process, it has been stressed that test subjects will still be required to hold a valid passport with them. \"Finnair from Finland, the Croatian Ministry for the Interior and the AKD company from Croatia are involved in the project. In addition, the Finnish National Police Administration, the Finnish Immigration Service and Fina via are participating in the project as associated partnersâ€, the Finnish Border Guard said. Verify 365 offers MyID Digital Identity Wallet which can be used to manage your electronic identity and authorisations in one location. Your electronic identity is always available on your mobile phone. You can log and/or sign documents anywhere and anytime. MyID Digital Identity is a safe, secure and convenient way to prove who you are online, to access government online services. Your Digital Identity allows you to prove who you are online for work, education and personal use, and you can re-use your Digital Identity whenever you need it. What makes MyID so easy to use? ~ Works for you. You're always in control of your digital identity. You choose which data to share, with who and when. ~ Everything's in one place. No more searching for lost documents. Store all your identity information securely and access the parts you need instantly. ~ Protects against Identity fraud. With identity theft on the rise, MyID makes sure no one can pretend to be you and commit fraud or other crimes in your name. ~ Verify once, and share again and again. Once MyID has verified your identity, you're verified forever. Then it's easy to share only the details you really need to, whenever you need to. ~ Stops children from accessing age-restricted products. Only over 18s verified using biometrics can get a MyID. So children can't use a fake or borrowed ID to access products and services they shouldn't. ~ Meets the highest security standards. MyID is built using DynamicID technology by Verify 365, certified compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 information security standards and security controls audited using the ISAE 3000 (SOC2) methodology. MyID Digital Identity is a secure and easy way to prove who you are online. You can create your secure Digital Identity, such as MyID, using identity documents like your driver's licence and your passport. Set up MyID Set up your myGovID in 3 easy steps. ~ Contact Verify 365 and request MyID access code. Download the Verify 365 app from the Apple App Store or Google Play. ~ Open the app and follow the prompts to enter your details. ~ Verify your ID biometric NFC document with at least 2 proof of address documents to get verified MyID. MyID uses encryption and cryptographic technology and the security features in your device, such as fingerprint or face, to protect your identity. You're in control as your personal information is only shared with your consent.
