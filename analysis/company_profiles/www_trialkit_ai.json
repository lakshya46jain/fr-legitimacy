    "Criminal defense law software & AI tool Over the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been making headlines and changing industries at a breakneck pace. Some businesses are using it to power chatbots, while others are creating facial recognition protocols, processing data, and even speeding up research. While AI is still developing in many areas, it's already a powerful tool. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are certainly using AI in their mission to identify and prosecute people, and defense attorneys can use AI to protect their clients' rights and freedom. What is artificial intelligence? Despite the name, AI isn't truly intelligent in the sense of experiencing conscious and independent thought. Rather, it's an advanced piece of software that can recognize patterns, take input and adapt to it, solve problems, make plans, and process human language. These feats are possible through access to massive amounts of data to \"learn.†In short, AI is a tool that can process data very quickly, recognize patterns, and organize and present data in meaningful ways. How can AI factor into criminal defense? Saving time on research It's no secret that the life of a criminal defense attorney is a busy one. Rather than needing to pore over thousands of pages of data—think witness statements, police reports, and affidavits—attorneys can utilize AI-based criminal defense software to pull relevant data and present it in efficient and accessible ways. This saves countless hours and frees up time to build a better case. Identifying patterns and trends As AI legal software sifts through mountains of data, it can recognize patterns that may not be apparent to a human. Because AI criminal defense software can process so much data at once, it can look at evidence through a broader scope. This allows the program to find common ground between seemingly unrelated data or trace trends in unexpected areas. AI analytics could change the face of criminal defense, finally putting defenders on a more level ground with the over-resourced agencies and systems they fight every day.
