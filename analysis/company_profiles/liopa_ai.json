    "Visual Speech Recognition Deciphers speech from lip movement State-of-the-art deep learning Visual Speech Recognition Deciphers speech from lip movement State-of-the-art deep learning Deciphers speech from lip movement Overview – VSR Applications Liopa Visual Speech Recognition has three main application use cases. Liopa Visual Speech Recognition has three main application use cases. Transforming the Voice UI Improving accuracy of speech recognition. Making voice-driven applications better: Virtual Assistants – Siri, Cortana, Alexa In vehicle Voice Activation Smart Home device control Transforming the Voice UI Improving accuracy of speech recognition. Making voice-driven applications better: Virtual Assistants – Siri, Cortana, Alexa In vehicle Voice Activation Smart Home device control Liveness Detection Improved online and mobile User Authentication for enhanced security: ensuring a real person is present anti-spoofing for Facial Recognition alternative to CAPTCHA Improved online and mobile User Authentication for enhanced security: ensuring a real person is present anti-spoofing for Facial Recognition Keyword Spotting Identify occurrences of words/phrases in video footage: Surveillance video analysis Broadcast monitoring Transcription assistance Identify occurrences of words/phrases in video footage: Transforming the Voice UI Transforming the Voice UI Voice is now perceived as the future of the User Interface, ultimately replacing keyboard, mouse and touchpad. Today's voice-driven UIs (e.g. Alexa, Siri) depend on Audio Speech Recognition ( ASR ) technology. But ASR accuracy & user experience can be severely impacted by background noise. Liopa's VSR – LipRead – is video only & not affected by poor audio quality and background noise. Liopa's VSR – LipRead – is video only & not affected by poor audio quality and background noise. Liopa's VSR – LipRead – is video only & not affected by poor audio quality and background noise. LipRead improves word accuracy in real-world/noisy environments to offer seamless, intuitive language-processing accuracy for enhanced voice user interface.

LipRead employs a proprietary Machine Learning approach using Deep Learning & can be 'intelligently' integrated with ASR technology using dynamic weighting algorithms. Biometrics are increasingly used in on-line authentication – but can be compromised with an artificial replica of biometric used. For example, a photograph or video of a subject can compromise (spoof) many Facial Recognition systems. There is a need to ensure a real 'live' person is present. User is asked to repeat on-screen sequence of digits. Liopa's VSR technology checks if digits are spoken correctly and thus determines if 'live' person is present.
