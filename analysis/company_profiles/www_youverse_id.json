    "Biometric in Things API Welcome to the Biometric In Things (BiT) API, an offering within Youverse Services The BiT API is built as a RESTful API hosted with in a local server running on-premises. All requests and responses are encoded in JSON. The concept of Biometric In Things was designed to bring face authentication to the edge in developer friendly fashion by exposing complex biometric functionalities via a simple REST API that can be integrated virtually in any programming language, in any environment. {primary} Live face capture Detection and capture of aligned faces using ICAO Token Face Images according to ISO/IEC 19794-5 standard. {primary} Live face verification Design to build user authentication/verification in edge devices using reference face images already collected. Common use cases are face authentication based on a passport collected photo like in our VR-eKiosk project or by providing the picture obtained with the provided face capture endpoint . {primary} Face images verification When you need to validate if the two face images belong to the same person you can use this functionality. For example, when integrating with a passport reader on a Kiosk, you can perform a face verification step between the chip image and the scan passport photo to check for data integrity and increase the security of your applications. To start using Youverse BiT, please visit our website and find the subscription that fits your needs. Afterwards, please follow the instruction below that fit best your scenario: Binaries installation - Windows only Download the binary files .

Call the setup API endpoint to install everything automatically. You need to provide the x-api-key key from your subscription in the HTTP request header. This request may take some time depending on your internet connection. All endpoints that receive images accept jpg/jpeg, png and bmp formats converted in base64 images. The recommended resolution for optimal results is at least VGA (640×480 px). Smaller resolutions are accepted, but might not provide optimal results. Larger resolutions are also accepted, but won't improve the authentication process significantly and can result in considerable increase of the processing times. The Youverse.BiT supports out of the box the following camera drivers/types: To ask for additional camera support please contact us . Changing camera is as simply as change two lines of the configuration file. By default the config is compatible with UVC and Video4Linux. Use Intel RealSense cameras Endpoint that returns current API availability and processing capabilities status. Check if the camera is currently connected and available for processing. {warning} This method activates the camera and disconnects it again. Calling this method too often can resolve in high stress to the device leading to failure. It should not be used before calling processing methods since it will stress the camera and increase processing times. Endpoint that configures the Biometric In Things server. Only needs to be call once. Until the setup call does not return a suucess status code, the software will not be operational. {warning} This method might take sometime to return depending on your internet speed since it s checking-out the latest face authentication models. Endpoint that provides biometric capture capabilities using live stream from the configured camera. This endpoint can be used to capture the face for future reference or verification. Endpoint that provides verification capabilities by comparing reference image with the live capture from camera. The request accepts a face picture that can be obtained from passport scanning or any other source, e.g. using the capture endpoint . Verification of two images Endpoint that provides verification capabilities between two face images. The request accepts two pictures, obtained for instance from the passport page scanning and passport chip, and provides a similarity score between the two. Accepts: Verify Images Request String with generic error messages. {warning} It is strongly advised to not take action based on the text messages, these are meant for logging purposes only. Any action should be implemented based on status codes. Configurations to the face acquisition process. Face capture with image and capture status results. Live face verification process request. Provides two face images for comparison. Face images verification results. Please check our github space for more information about our integration SDKs. We are looking into expand our current SDK offers, if you want to contribute please contact us .",
    "Welcome to Identity Verification, an offering within Youverse Services . Identity verification is typically used as a robust registration mechanism to verify users' identity using a personal identity document, face verification between a live picture and the identity document, and anti-spoofing/liveness checks to detect a real user performing the registration. The Identity Verification was design to be integrated into any application in a developer friendly fashion by abstracting all the complexity of document OCR, document validation and face biometric verification to build great UX. {primary} Identity Verification to your User Onboarding Flow Enable strong user onboarding to your flow to avoid bots and scammers on your platform. Identity verification enables scanning documents from 138 languages spanning 248 countries and territories. {primary} Authentication with identity Enable subsequent user authentication based on the identity verification performed during onboarding. Be sure that only the rightful owner is accessing their assets or services. {primary} Privacy-preserving identity verification We don't store any data from your customer on our servers. Once the identity verification is completed all data is sent to your server unless you request otherwise. Your customers, your rules! The recommended resolution for optimal results is at least 1080p (1920×1080 pixels). Smaller resolutions are accepted but might not provide optimal results. Larger resolutions are also accepted but might slow down the processing times. Identity verification is recommended to be done on mobile devices with pictures taken from rear cameras of mobile devices for the document scanning and front camera for the selfie pictures. Images acquired with laptops or web cameras usually have lower resolution and image noise arising from compression; therefore, they might not perform well. Nevertheless, both solutions are supported in our solution to comply with usage from Kiosk Apps or other desktop-like scenarios. Document verification algorithms are developed to allow variances in the capture process related to subject-device integration. Keep in mind that the developed intelligent system cannot overcome the laws of physics and works exclusively within its capabilities. Please see the expected acquisition conditions to obtain optimal performance: Good lighting helps to achieve better OCR results. If the image is too dark or too bright, the document might not be processed successfully. Glares and reflections interfere with processing and reduce data extraction accuracy. We recommend not to use the flash of your mobile device when capturing document images. Make sure the image is clear and there are no blurred areas. The tilt angle of the document should not exceed 10 degrees in any direction (horizontal or vertical). Make sure there is minimal space around the document. It is recommended that the document takes up 70-80% of the image. Make sure the space around the document does not take up more than 20-30% of the image. It is recommended that the document takes up 70-80% of the image. The document should be in clear contrast to the background. A light-colored document on a light background, as well as a dark-colored document on a dark background, might not be recognized. Resolution of the image To achieve a good quality of recognition of identification documents, we recommend that you provide images captured by a camera with a resolution of at least Full HD (1920×1080) and autofocus. Make sure your hands or other objects do not cover document data. After a subscription is done successfully, you need to set up your environment by filling the following fields in your dashboard : Allow Origins : A set of URLs that will be allowed to make requests to our API/Services. All URLs will be allowed if this field is left empty . Allow Origins : A set of URLs that will be allowed to make requests to our API/Services. All URLs will be allowed if this field is left empty . Webhook Url : URL on your server that we will use to send the identity verification results (as a POST request). Webhook Url : URL on your server that we will use to send the identity verification results (as a POST request). You can also find your Client ID ( client_id ), base endpoint ( base_url ), and API Key ( x-api-key ) in the dashboard. The Identity Verification can be integrated as an iFrame into any existing web apps, covering a full range of use cases such as hotel check-in apps, loyalty registration, or opening banking accounts). With the integration via an iFrame, the identity verification process is displayed directly on your website without redirecting. Alternatively, we also support redirecting to our service to perform the Id verification process, and then calling back your application/website. Generate the JSON Web Token (JWT) For each identity verification flow, a JWT should be generated by calling the following endpoint: The iFrame can be embedded into the HTML code using the following snippet: The base_url parameter can be found in your dashboard and the token parameter is the previously generated JWT. Alternatively to an iFrame, we also support redirecting the user to our service directly (you can perform a redirect to the same URL used in the iFrame: <base_url>?token=<token> ). In this case, the redirect_url parameter in the Token request is required in order to redirect back the user to your application/website after the identity verification process is complete. Getting the results in the Webhook Webhooks are one of a few ways web applications can communicate with each other. They allow sending real-time data from one application to another whenever a given event occurs. Youverse will send a POST request to the Webhook URL you defined in the dashboard with the results of the process. This request will also have your x-api-key in its header so you can confirm it came from Youverse. Request to generate the JWT. Response with the generated JWT. Error response when generating JWT. Object with the identity verification process results. The document field will be present only if the user is validated by passing the face matching score and liveness checks. Object with all the document information. Status check is performed based on the available document visible light features and data sources. Validation information and their corresponding validation sources. Validation sources can come from MRZ string, Visual OCR, Chip information or others. Description of the document text fields using Visual (when available), MRZ (when available) and Chip (when available).
