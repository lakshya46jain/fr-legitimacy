    "NEW FRONTIERS IN MACHINE VISION Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC is a new (2015) artificial intelligence company with proprietary software that allows us to develop powerful new machine vision technology. Our emphasis is on autonomous mobility, navigation, and object/face recognition in all fields. Nirenberg Neuroscience (NN) develops machine vision on a principle that allows easy generalization – that is, it allows machine vision tasks such as navigation, collision avoidance, object recognition, and face recognition, to be performed in a broad range of conditions (lighting conditions, environments). NN's method has a low footprint: the learning algorithms are shallow compared to deep learning networks, using many, many fewer operations to achieve very high performance (e.g., 1000-fold fewer for several applications such as face feature detection, pedestrian detection, and navigation). NN's talented technical team of engineers and programmers are building up an array of platforms for a variety of machine vision applications across multiple fields of use. Ford Motor Company has already licensed a first round of platforms for one field of use, to \"bring human-like intelligence to the machine learning modules of [their] autonomous vehicle virtual driver system.†See Ford press release . NN was founded by Sheila Nirenberg, a professor at Cornell, who is also the founder of a company that develops new kinds of prosthetic devices (Bionic Sight LLC). Dr. Nirenberg has won numerous awards for her innovations, including a MacArthur \"genius†Award. Her work on cracking the neural code has been featured in a TED talk, a BBC documentary, \"The Genius Behind…â€, a Bloomberg News documentary, the Washington Post's \"Transformersâ€, among many others. For peer-reviewed scientific publications, see Nirenberg lab website . Check back for updates and a new TED talk (on our technology and its implications).
