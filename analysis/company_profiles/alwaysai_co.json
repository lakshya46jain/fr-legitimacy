    "Explore what computer vision can do for you and your business! Give your drones and robots smart vision for instant decisions Improve traffic and parking and understand usage of public spaces Monitor marine life and ecosystems with object detection and tracking Optimize quality control and develop advanced human-machine-interfaces Detect skin cancer and other diseases faster and with increased accuracy AI has the potential to change medicine radically and can help provide affordable healthcare to millions of deserving people. Medical diagnosis relies on CAT scans, MRI images, X-rays, sonograms, and other images. Computer vision applications help diagnose patients by processing, analyzing, and categorizing images and can process thousands of images in minutes or even seconds. Computer vision can automate tasks such as: Detecting physical irregularities in the body by processing thousands of images quickly. Mitigating the consequences of human error in reading medical images. Save time in critical cases where earlier treatment means the difference between life and death. Sorting and extracting medical images at a remarkable pace to assign diagnoses. Computer vision applications have enabled phenomenal and continuing superiority in modern medicine. The applications will only outperform themselves as time and technology evolve. Minimize production costs and improve crop yields Computer vision will be an essential component of agriculture automation, helping farmers minimize their cost of production and improve the crop yield with better efficiency. AI robotics can help perform tasks such as: Flying drones can capture a considerable amount of data through their cameras equipped with intelligent sight, which can be used to monitor the health of crops and check soil conditions through geo sensing and visual sensing. Semantic segmentation, object detection and object counting can be used in agriculture, from product to livestock. Automate disposal and sorting with smart waste management systems Approximately 1.3 billion tons of garbage are produced globally on a daily basis. Garbage sorting and disposal can be automated by using AI and computer vision for smart recycling and waste management. Trash bots can be used to sort through waste and identify bottles, cans and other recyclable items. Object detection can be used to automate the sorting of items in landfills.

Trash bots can be used to sort through waste and identify bottles, cans and other recyclable items. Object detection can be used to automate the sorting of items in landfills. Keep personal and commercial environments safe and responsive Computer vision can be used to keep public spaces densely populated areas safe. It is affordable to equip security cameras with computer vision, and makes them much more accurate in detecting security threats. In large public spaces where there is a lot of traffic, security cameras can generate a high amount of video streams to be processed. No human can digest dozens of video streams continuously whereas computer vision can be more accurate. Computer vision cameras can continuously monitor people and patterns and look for indications of security concern as well as systematically search a field of view for objects of interest. Improve family and elder care with pose estimation Computer vision will take smart homes to the next level, as intelligent sight offers advanced sensing solutions for home devices. When systems can detect and recognize objects, they can deliver smart actions according to what they were programmed to do. One example is a refrigerator using computer vision to look into a fridge and assess what is needed and trigger an order from amazon fresh or other home delivery services. For the elderly and disabled, robots can even call for help if they see that someone has fallen, or assist with mobility around the home. The alwaysAI platform is now integrated with Twilio so you can interact with the smart cameras in your home. You can have automated text messages sent to you and be notified in real-time when an event occurs at your home. Understand customer behavior and create targeted experiences Retail and restaurant establishments can benefit from computer vision to acquire data on customer behavior and demographics. In addition to providing retailers with demographic insights, computer vision can help brick and mortar retailers by assisting with planograms. A planogram is a diagram of retail products showing how they should be placed on the shelves to increase customer purchases. Usually, companies hire a professional to do this and have them regularly check the merchandise arrangement. The average cost for manually generating a planogram report is $72, but with the help of AI and computer vision, this can be reduced to $8 per report, which is a 9x savings. Retail owners are expected to spend around $34 billion on AI technology by 2025. 29% of this amount is predicted to go to computer vision for its ability to facilitate inventory reports, contribute to customer analytics, and empower checkout-free shopping models Detect pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles and prevent collisions Computer Vision is an essential component of autonomous vehicles. Detecting pedestrians and bicyclists in a cityscape scene is a crucial part of autonomous driving applications. Autonomous vehicles need to determine how far away pedestrians and bicyclists are, as well as what their intentions are. Semantic Segmentation is the best tool to use for detecting pixel-by-pixel rather than with bounding boxes. Accurate object avoidance in real-time is essential for passenger and pedestrian safety. Facilitate productive and engaging online learning environments There are many applications of Computer Vision in education. Computer vision can maximize students' academic output by providing a customized learning experience based on their individual strengths and weaknesses. This is accomplished by observing students' behavioral patterns during the learning process to gauge engagement. This is especially relevant and beneficial in online learning situations. With computer vision, online educators can analyze user behavior, eye movement, and posture to assess engagement levels. This helps educators study student behavior in order to help guide future courses.",
