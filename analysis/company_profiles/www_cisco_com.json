    "Lawful Intercept Description National Laws Define Local Intercept Requirements Additional Lawful Intercept Resources Cisco Internet-Draft on Lawful Intercept Control NOTICE : This information is supplied for Service Provider's research purposes only and is subject to change. The contents of this site do not constitute either legal advice or any representation, warranty or guarantee regarding a Service Provider's ability to comply with applicable Lawful Intercept requirements. Such a determination is the sole responsibility of the Service Provider, and Cisco disclaims any and all liability for the accuracy or completeness of the information contained herein. Lawful Intercept Description The term \"Lawful Intercept\" is used to describe the process by which law enforcement agencies conduct electronic surveillance of circuit and packet-mode communications as authorized by judicial or administrative order. There are various methods and technologies that are used to intercept telecommunications. Therefore, the process used may vary on a case-by-case basis. However, for reasons of cost and expediency, legislation and regulation are increasingly being adopted that require providers of public and private communication services (Service Providers) to design and implement their networks to explicitly support authorized electronic surveillance. National Laws Define Local Intercept Requirements The means and authority of conducting Lawful Intercept is often recorded in government legislation or regulatory mandates. Examples of such a mandates include but are not limited to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in the United States; the United Kingdom's Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIPA) Act 2000 , Section 88 of Germany's Telekommunikationsgesetz , and The Netherlands' Telecommunicatiewet of 1998 . The types of Service Providers who are subject to such Lawful Intercept mandates, as well as the services included, vary greatly from country to country. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that customers consult with legal counsel knowledgeable in the laws and regulations applying to their situation in order to determine their responsibility for complying with Lawful Intercept requirements.
