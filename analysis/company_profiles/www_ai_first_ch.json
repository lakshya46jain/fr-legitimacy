    "TurtleBot: Navigation and Image Processing Authors Marija Todosovska, Simon Hermann, Dajana Stojcevska Research fields / Keywords Machine vision, Intelligent navigation, Robot navigation, Face detection, Face recognition Publication year 2018 Publication CiiT The problem of this project was to create a solution which would allow a TurtleBot to explore a bordered space under specific circumstances. A TurtleBot is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software. The problem was set as a bordered field in which there were a number of faces, rings and cylinders. The robot would explore the field, recognize the faces in it, find the rings and cylinders, and pick up the rings. It would talk with the people in order to infer information and perform specific tasks. We used ROS and OpenCV for the solution to this problem. The robot scanned the field using the Kinect sensor and stored a map of it. We used the canny edge detector, and the k nearest neighbors algorithm provided by OpenCV, and vector transformations in order to approach objects on the field. We used the ViCos Lab face-detector for face detections. For the cylinder detection we used the Point cloud library and the RANSAC algorithm. We implemented the speech recognition using the Google recognition application. The general logic of our implementation can be split into two main parts: the search for faces, rings and cylinders, and the conversation with the people. We performed the integration of all these parts during runtime by calling specific scripts in a specific order. The ring and cylinder detection was implemented well and worked correctly. All the faces were detected and recognized correctly, and the logic of the solution worked well and made the correct conclusions. Altogether, the solution performed well to the task, with the minor exception of not always picking up all rings.

    "Comparison of different model's performances in task of document classification Authors Kristijan Spirovski, Evgenija Stevanoska, Andrea Kulakov, Zaneta Popeska, Goran Velinov Reasearch fields / Keywords Artificial intelligence, machine learning, information systems, natural language processing Publication year 2018 Publication WIMS '18, ACM New York Although the number of additional resources in Macedonian which can be used for solving information retrieval problem (or general Natural Language Processing problem) is very limited, models exist which are general enough and do not need additional knowledge about the language. This paper presents a document classification model, that doesn't rely on any language specific additional resources. The model is trained and tested on a set of news articles extracted from Macedonian websites, and each document is labeled with a class representing one of the twelve category sections from which the documents were extracted. The goal of this paper is to test different methods for feature selection and choice of vocabulary. Furthermore, we choose a model which gives the best accuracy for document classification task and we make sensitivity analysis on its architecture in order to further improve its performance. Although similar research already exists, this paper aims to combine different experiments and test them on Macedonian language documents. The models used in this paper are Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Network (NN). The performed experiments showed that the best accuracy is achieved when each document is represented as tf-idf vector, the vocabulary contains equal number of representative words from each class, and simple Neural Network with 3 hidden layers is used as a model. The main conclusion is that a language independent model for solving document classification problem can be successfully build for Macedonian language, achieving around 80% accuracy on the test set.

Fabrimex Systems , specialist for industrial cameras, embedded computing and machine vision in Switzerland, is an early adopter of this machine learning based technology from AI First. The software can be trained to identify defective work pieces during the manufacturing process, speeding up the supply chain and lowering production costs. The development of technical machinery and equipment has become increasingly complex in recent years. At the same time, the product life cycles have become shorter. Detection of defects has to keep up with this development. Traditional computer models were in many cases unsuccessful in detecting the proper object shapes and the defects. Leveraging machine learning (ML) leads to successful and automated detection without human interaction. For Fabrimex Systems, AI First is currently developing the product fs-vision that can be deployed on production lines equipped with an overhead camera. Based on a small training set of images, the product detects similar and previously unseen defects on its own. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) applying the technology can therefore speed up their entire supply chain while lowering costs. Thomas Graf, Head of Image Processing at Fabrimex: \"We are certain that AI First is the right partner to build this visionary product with us. Together, we are a diverse team with longstanding technological experience as well as industry knowhow – just the right combination that enables us to serve better our customers in the manufacturing industries.\" Leverage ML to detect the smallest defects in real-time fs-vision from AI First is based on deep learning techniques and consists of two modules: a trainer and a detector. The trainer requires a set of labeled (\"OK\" and \"not OK\") image data each to produce a machine learning model. This model is then used by the detector to identify defects in real-time. When new objects need to be processed or when environmental conditions change, a retraining of the model requires almost no efforts or expert knowledge. This allows OEMs to rapidly adapt their production to market requests. As the work pieces can be rather small with dimensions of 100mm x 80mm or even much smaller, the solution has to be very precise. As a result, defects can be very small, like e.g. an eyelash, and hard to detect. Defects might include foreign particles, impurities like grease or dirt, damages (holes, tears, rips), bad or unclear printing (no or partial printing, double printing). Nithin Mathews, Business Developer at AI First: \"Most OEMs have existing standards and business know-how when it comes to measuring the quality of their products. Machine learning leverages this knowledge and automates many of the manual steps still part of the quality assurance process in the manufacturing industry.\" Author Angelika Seiler Machine learning based defect detection for OEMs AI First and Fabrimex Systems launch new software product Fabrimex Systems relies on AI First to expand their product offering: the joint venture by 4Quant and Netcetera offering AI-driven software services is developing the computer vision product fs-vision that can detect defects on production lines.
