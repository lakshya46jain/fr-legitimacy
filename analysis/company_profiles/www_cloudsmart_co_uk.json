At CloudSmart, we understand that staying ahead of the curve is not just an option but a necessity. Here are our top 3 features from the Spring 24 release: Feature Highlights: 1. Dynamic forms with related object fields. Formula field who?! Move over formula fields… your old news now! With the Spring 24 release you can add a field from another object onto your lightning page as long as there is a look up relationship! Of course, formula fields still have so many uses and we still love them really! This is just such a great way to minimise unnecessary field creation and keep your data clean. 2. Transfer Lightning Dashboard Ownership. This one is for the Salesforce Admins out there! We have all been there, when the owner of a dashboard leaves the company and you have to clone and recreate the dashboard, WHY?! Well the ability to transfer dashboards is now available. This might be a simple change, but for admins, this really is a biggie! 3. New Dashboard components. So number 3 is also an update related to dashboard's, but its a great one! Get ready to spend hours fine tuning your dashboards and giving them the Spring Glo they deserve. With images, rich text and dashboard widgets now available. There are so many more features, but these are just a few we think you can get your hands on and enjoy.
