    "PREDICTMEDIX AI powered products use facial, thermal, video and audio recognition technologies to determine when individuals are impaired, suffering from infectious disease or mental illness. CANNABIS AND ALCOHOL IMPAIRMENT Our technology is quick, non-invasive, contactless screening that​ requires very little training to administer. It can be d eployed easily in any workplace and easy to use for law enforcement officials. PredictMedix is the f irst solution to identify impairment and no need for any biologics. INFECTIOUS DISEASE Experts agree outbreaks of COVID19 will revive in waves. By deploying PREDICTMEDIX virtually anywhere, we detect infections and analyze hot spot locations early. Giving Public Health authorities the ability to proactively protect populations. PREDICTMEDIX can be deployed in settings outside of hospitals and healthcare facilities. Airports, malls, stadiums, government and office buildings, casinos, spiritual and cultural events, performances, festivals, and conferences. Any location where large numbers of people gather or where transmission security is paramount. MENTAL ILLNESS PREDICTMEDIX can effectively determine early signs of mental illnesses , including depression, dementia and other brain disorders. It will be deployed in healthcare facilities and medical offices and will provide practitioners with a simple, measurable diagnostic tool to detect signs of these disorders at early stages. It is expected that workplaces will also use PREDICTMEDIX to protect and care for the mental health of their workforce. COVID19 Screening FAQ How does the tech respond to people who are completely asymptomatic: ​ Based on WHO report, an asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed case is a person infected with COVID-19 who does not develop symptoms. Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person, who does not develop symptoms. There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases who are truly asymptomatic, and to date, there has been no documented asymptomatic transmission. This does not exclude the possibility that it may occur. Asymptomatic cases have been reported as part of contact tracing efforts in some countries. Data from published epidemiology and virologic studies provide evidence that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from symptomatic people to others who are in close contact through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. This is supported by detailed experiences shared by technical partners via WHO global expert networks, and reports and presentations by Ministries of Health. As such based on current data, symptomatic transmission is responsible for the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, the key is to identify the majority of symptomatic individuals to prevent transmission which is the purpose of our mass screening technology. Is there a percentage of accuracy we can speak to? ​ The accuracy in identification of underlying symptoms of COVID-19 has an association with the sensitivity of multispectral cameras that are used for screening purposes. Therefore, we have minimum specifications for what is needed to ensure a high resolution can be maintained which can in turn ensure a high rate of accuracy. Our technology is designed to mass screen and encompass major symptoms associated with COVID-19 to ensure that most of the people who are likely to have COVID-19 are identified and prevented from entering the premises. Will I show \"positive†with a common cold or flu? ​ At the moment, any outbreak associated with common cold or flu is by default to be associated with COVID-19. Therefore health agencies are recommending that anyone who is showing associated symptoms avoid stepping out altogether. The only definitive way of distinguishing between common cold/flu/COVID-19 is a diagnostic test. Although currently we cannot between the two, our AI algorithms are deep learning based and as there is more data analyzed by the algorithms they get smarter. How long does the system take to process a scan? ​ The system can have the results usually within a fraction of the second (0.1-0.4 seconds) but at times due to low internet connectivity, it may extend to 1-2 seconds. What kind of internet bandwidth is required for the mass screening? ​ Typically internet bandwidth of above 25 Mbps should be needed for a single scan station. How does the COVID-19 mass screening technology work? ​ The artificial intelligence (\"AIâ€) powered technology utilizes multispectral imaging with a focus on visual spectral imaging along with infrared thermography to identify cases which are suspected of COVID-19. The AI technology monitors and identifies potential presence of COVID-19 associated symptoms such as fatigue, headache, coughing, sneezing, blood flow, sweat gland activation, metabolism, fever along with other key determinant factors. Does the system require installation of any other hardware? ​ The units provided are self-sufficient and only requires internet connectivity. Multispectral cameras installed within the units communicate with the cloud servers for analysis. ​ DISCLAIMER: Reported symptoms associated with COVID-19 include fever, shortness of breath,cough, exhaustion, headaches and redness in the eyes. The system can be designed to rapidly, safely, without contact, scan large volumes of people for a certain set of symptoms. If there is a symptom found and confirmed, then additional inquiry is recommended as to why. The described symptoms are not a definitive marker of viral infection and just a possible symptom where additional medical advice should be sought. Furthermore, non symptomatic people can also be carriers of contagious disease, so even those without symptoms are not necessarily without the disease. Always consult your physician for personalized medical advice. It's out of an abundance of caution that our technology is part of a holistic approach to public safety. The system can only detect certain symptoms and does not diagnose any virus or disease. This system is not approved or cleared by the FDA or Health Canada. The outcome from our system should not be solely or primarily relied upon to diagnose or exclude a diagnosis of COVID-19, or any other disease.

    "June 10, 2020 ( Source ) – Predictmedix to offer a fully integrated enterprise solution for healthcare along with workplace health, safety, and compliance. Predictmedix Inc. (CSE:PMED) (OTCQB:PMEDF) (\"Predictmedix†or the \"Companyâ€) is pleased to announce the acquisition of MobileWellbeing, an innovative, feature rich, Telemedicine Remote Patient Monitoring platform that will integrate with Predictmedix's Artificial Intelligence (\"AIâ€) driven rapid screening system for infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This will also integrate with the Company's screening modules for impairment and mental illness. The MobileWellbeing platform addresses several of the gaps currently observed with comparable platforms which are offered by a few public companies trading at high valuations. MobileWellbeing has demonstrated its value in multiple different programs over several years, and has shown benefits such as improved patient health, minimized the impact of chronic disease, and driven down the cost for care through remote monitoring. The technology has been successfully used at Arnprior District Memorial Hospital for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Ottawa/Ontario), Algonquin College (Nursing department) for diabetes management and StonyBrook Hospital (New York, US) with the Pediatrics team that manage patients in the community with high risk pregnancies, teenage pregnancies and mothers in low income housing for wellness of their infants. The technology has also been used by the Cardiology department for Hypertension. Compared to its competitive environment, MobileWellbeing has a unique and robust set of features such as, Assisted Monitoring that allows for data collection, transmission, evaluation, notification and intervention at home or through kiosks that might be especially useful in Long Term Care and Retirement Community settings. The Interactive Voice Response System also gives patients the accessibility to interact with the system without the need for internet connected devices. This is an important consideration given the breadth of population affected and for regions, sometimes remote, where connectivity remains a major issue. Dr. Rahul Kushwah, COO of Predictmedix, explains, \"We are excited to roll in the MobileWellbeing business that is already working with the healthcare system in both Canada and the United States. Its presence in these health care sectors will provide enhanced credibility to future clients as Predictmedix expands its market reach. The key to getting back to work, back to school, back to business, is knowing when someone is potentially infected, taking the appropriate safety measures immediately, then monitoring and supporting these individuals to ensure their recovery from COVID-19 and the emotional toll are professionally managed. So, when it's safe for them to go back to work, they are healthy and ready. Additionally, the many features offered by MobileWellbeing allow us to align the right telemedicine tools for each type of user and for each of our three products – Infectious Disease Screening (including COVID-19), Cannabis and Alcohol Impairment Screening, and Mental Illness Screening.†The MobileWellbeing platform's suite of features are uniquely applicable to multiple use cases that impact Predictmedix clientele.
