    "The core of any business is its customers, and finding and maintaining the right customers involves precision targeting, at the right time. There is no doubt that today, the market offers a wealth of advertising options, each with their own unique benefits, strategy, and methods. To top it off, you are able to measure the success of these campaigns using a variety of metrics including PPC, CPA, CTR, CPM and CPC. At the foundation of these traditional forms of advertising is a focus on the analytics of customers' behavior and cookies. These methods also use broad targeting and segmentation techniques. Imagine though if you could take this a step further and elevate the accuracy and strategy of your advertising by building your campaigns and target the right customers solely on customers' biological parameters, extracted from their facial photos. This is where Facetrom SPS AD takes center stage. Is your advertising really producing the results you want? Facetrom AdTech – Advertising based on users' biology. MAR-TECH EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STRATEGY CUSTOMIZATION LANDING PAGE CPM (COST PER MILLE) A major expense for any company is their marketing. Quality campaigns can cost up to millions of dollars and before a company invests in campaigns, surely they should have insight into the possible impact that the different advertising strategies will have? With Facetrom SPS AD, companies can have a clear understanding beforehand of the potential effectiveness and how it will contribute to customer acquisition. Each person is unique in their own way so why do companies persist in using the same ad, brochure or newsletter for their entire customer base? In order to truly 'speak' to potential customers, you need to be delivering ads that will have the greatest impact on the individual, based on their individual biological characteristics. Using Facetrom SPS AD, matches specific ads to a client's biological makeup, resulting in increased accuracy and engagement and ultimately, increased revenue. Why are different customers redirected to the same landing pages of a site? This 'one-size-fits-all' approach is ineffective as it reduces the impact of advertising based on people's individuality. Each customer should be directed to a customized landing page, with content and pictures that match their biological makeup. This will expand user engagement with the company's site, while also enhancing advertising possibilities and revenues. In order to increase the CPM value of a company, the 1000 ads used would need to be as effective as possible. With SPS AD, advertising companies will now have access to customized data that shows the optimal ad for each user, thereby increasing the power of these ads. With optimized advertising, ad agencies, networks and exchanges can charge higher fees for CPM, while also increasing the CPM value for each company. CPC (COST PER CLICK) Interestingly, research has shown that when ads have presenters, people or models in them, these ads are more effective and produce higher results. Now, imagine if we could identify exactly which presenters, people or models should be used in each ad in order to produce a higher CPC. This is exactly what Facetrom SPS AD does. As a result, your company will achieve a higher CPC rate, build a greater awareness to your brand, obtain more qualified leads and most importantly, achieve improved revenue. EMAIL MARKETING The approach in most companies today is to send similar and generalized emails to the company's customer base. In addition, the A/B testing system is often used, however, this method often causes companies to lose those potential clients who are more engaged to the A or B option and who are more likely to increase the CTR on these company emails. With SPS AD, the most appropriate content can be sent to each user based on their biological parameters. By finetuning company communications with their clients, businesses can achieve a higher call to action. SMART TV The next generation of personalized advertisements will be on the Smart TV and Digital shows. Ads presented on this medium should not be created and then presented simply based on a user's behavior as this provides limited, subjective information that exists within an environment that has a lot of 'noise'. SPS AD is a powerful and effective tool that enables companies to quickly customize ads based on their user's favorite models or actors that appear on the Smart TV and Digital shows as well as in the company's branding campaigns. By presenting customized ads that match the user's biological makeup, your marketing quickly 'speaks' directly to each user, thereby enhancing their effectiveness. RETARGETING In the digital world today, most marketing is based on targeting the right audience at the right time. The question is, is this method the most effective? On the positive side, the marketing tactics used today are more successful than those used in the past as well as than those used on TV and print. On the down side, most advertising campaigns only achieve a CPC average of 2.7%. To top it off, even when a specific market is retargeted, these users are probably also being targeted by other advertisers within the same vertical. As a result, your ad campaigns are only reaching a small percentage of your target market. With SPS AD, retargeting your audience is streamlined based on the biological makeup of the users, enabling your company to achieve a far greater retargeting effectiveness. DATE MANAGEMENT PLATFORM Over 75% of the decisions people make are based on their sight; what they see. Let's now shift into the digital world, that is inundated with information, and understand that the data that is collected about these online users is 'noisy' and is based on subjective parameters that can be changed within seconds. Using Facetrom SPS AD ensures that all data provided about users is objective and based solely on the user's facial features and biological makeup. SPS AD provides accurate user data that is based on how a user 'sees' the world and it then goes a step further by predicting how the user's brain transfers and analyzes the information they obtained from their sense of sight. In this way, over 75% of a user's decisions can be accurately predicted, simply based on their facial features. ​FACETROM SPS AD IS EVOLVING THE ADVERTISING LANDSCAPE BASED ON USER'S BIOLOGY TRY OUR DEMO CONTACT US The core of any business is its customers, and finding and maintaining the right customers involves precision targeting, at the right time.

    "OUR STORY Decision making is a fundamental activity that everyone does, hundreds of times daily. However, many of the decisions we make are often inaccurate. This was proven in the research done by Prof. Barry Schwartz, in his study, \"Paradox of Choice\". The result is we all could be living better lives by modifying our decision making. Armed with this knowledge and research, the Facetrom team was driven to develop a technology that would give people and companies the ability to make better decisions, avoid costly mistakes and most importantly, enhance their lives. Facetrom was born to find that cure... The Facetrom team has a passionate motivation and unrelenting desire to understand why every person has a different appearance and how these differences affect a person's character, the decisions they make, their capabilities, talents, shortcomings and more. Based on this, we focused our attention on the correlation between biological and facial features and the decision-making process. The Facetrom team have extensive knowledge and experience in computer vision, image processing, machine learning, deep learning, AI, statistics, software engineering, psychology, evolutionary psychology, criminology, architecture, foundations of Chinese Medicine, management, economics and more. Today, Facetrom technology is being incorporated into various fields and sectors, such as human resources management, social networking, advertising and marketing, sports and many more. While we have been taught from a very young age that we should not \"judge a book by its cover\", Facetrom is disrupting this way of thinking and has successfully proven that our appearance is a critical component that enables us to make better decisions and to reach maximum achievements. We are merely scratching the surface of the potential of Facetrom technology, which evidently holds a key to unlocking the true potential of each person in the world. FACETROM IS A BREAKTHROUGH, CROSS-PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT BUILDS A PERSON'S PROFILE FROM A SINGLE FACIAL IMAGE TRY OUR DEMO CONTACT US OUR TECHNOLOGY 90% of the brain is involved in collecting information from the sense of sight 50% of the human brain is programmed to dealing with sight 33% of the brain deals with facial recognition 75% of human decisions depend on the sight sense A BRIEF HISTORY OF FACIAL FEATURE STUDIES The concept of studying facial features and trying to correlate these with their personality and capabilities is something we as humans have been trying to do for thousands of years. Ancient Greek scientists and philosophers explored these concepts and Aristotle was one of them who compiled a volume of how your looks affect your personality. As time has gone by, there have been many studies relating to the topic and there is substantial statistical data to back up much of this. One of the more recent studies was performed by Carmen LeFevre at Northumbria University who started to show that our biology, including our genes and hormone levels, influence our growth and features, and in the same way, this affects our characters. On a daily basis, we all form impressions and opinions based on other people's looks; we try to decrypt who the person really is, what their character is, their abilities, who can be a great match for him and much more, but until now these assessments were completely subjective and were never accurate. Facetrom Super Personalized System (SPS) now takes assessment to a completely new level… HOW FACETROM TECHNOLOGY WORKS With a single photo of a person's face, Facetrom tracks 69 key facial parameter landmarks and distinguishes more than 200 biological features including factors like hormones, immune system and more. This data is then subjected to 6,500 inequalities that compare the subjects' features against a database of historical data that allows the features to be matched on a biological level. The use of Facetrom predictions based on facial features is truly limitless… The entire process takes place in a mere 0.39 seconds, approximately the same amount of time it takes the human brain to process seeing an object. The result of all of this is the ability to build a detailed profile of a person with 89% accuracy. To back up the numbers and the data, Facetrom SPS was tested across 7 different academic institutions with more than 150,000 test subjects , which yielded an accuracy rate of 90.20%.

Our charter is to bank the unbanked About two billion adults in the world are unbanked or underbanked, i.e., they have no credit history or very limited bank account. This huge population practically cannot get any financial or insurance services from formal channels. The main alternative for these people to promote their lives, acquire education for their children, purchase health services, etc., is to borrow loans from non-formal channels (P2P, NBFCs, NBFIs, etc.). Eighty-seven percent of current loans in emerging countries are received from such channels. Nevertheless, out of the only ~15% of loan requests confirmed, ~5% turn out to be defaults or fraudsters (i.e., non-paying subscribers). The unbanked market has been noticed by many experts as 'the next trillion-dollar opportunity in fintech'. ​ Facetrom has developed a pioneering technology that predicts the financial risk of a potential customer requesting a loan, out of a single black and white image. The company's vision is to help unbanked and underbanked people achieve loans and insurance, while assisting the financial institutes to largely decrease the rate of non-paying subscribers.
