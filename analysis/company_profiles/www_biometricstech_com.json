    "Home | Site map | Search What is Biometrics, and what kind of convenience and security can it offer us? Biometrics refers to an automated system that can identify an individual by measuring their physical and behavioral uniqueness or patterns, and comparing it to those on record. In other words, instead of requiring personal identification cards, magnetic cards, keys or passwords, biometrics can identify fingerprints, face, iris, palm prints, signature, DNA, or retinas of an individual for easy and convenient verification. With the boom in Internet-based business and the increased need for accurate verification when accessing accounts, biometrics is the simplest and most convenient the solution. Its universal, unique, permanent and measurable features ensures security of information in E-commerce, such as on-line banking and shopping malls. Biometrics can also provide you with convenience and security, by enabling a machine to verify the individual by itself and to respond to the individuals requests. Through the use of such physical controls as access control, and punch card maintenance, user restrictions on certain apparatus can be made possible with an automated verification system.

We have also compiled a Biometrics information to help in understanding the terminology used in the biometrics industry. We offer that is focused on engineering, manufacturing and selling \"real world\" biometric solutions utilizing fingerprint verification biometric technologies. Our product begins life as a concept - a bold idea to make a task more simple, more efficient or to provide the user with improved security. We never stop thinking, developing or improving our products to meet the needs of our customers. Biometrics refers to the automatic identification of a person based on his/her physiological or behavioural characteristics. This method of identification is preferred over traditional methods involving passwords and PIN numbers for various reasons: The person to be identified is required to be physically present at the point-of-identification; Identification based on biometric techniques obviates the need to remember a password or carry a token.
