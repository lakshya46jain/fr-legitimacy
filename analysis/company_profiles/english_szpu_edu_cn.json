Construction of a Provincial-level Platform The Institute is active in research of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, where it has carried out tracking studies on the aging trend, investigated the distribution and allocation of elderly care service resources, and created a model for the allocation of elderly service resources in cities in the area. In addition, it publishes the Greater Bay Area Healthcare Resource Allocation Index and Healthcare Industry White Paper on a yearly basis, providing rationales for policy and business decisions. The Institute has also held healthcare summit forums, pooling outstanding experts inside and outside China to explore the path of dealing with the aging population problem in the Greater Bay Area. In the next three to five years, the Institute will work vigorously to develop the Greater Bay Area Healthcare Data Research Center, Greater Bay Area Healthcare Resource Allocation Index, Greater Bay Area Healthcare Industry White Paper, and Greater Bay Area Healthcare Industry Summit, thus building itself into an important platform for healthcare research and application in the Greater Bay Area and China, as well as a think tank for healthcare research in southern China. It will bring together and train experts in the healthcare industry, contributing wisdom to the national strategy dealing with the aging population problem.
