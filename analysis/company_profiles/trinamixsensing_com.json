    "trinamiX at LASER World of PHOTONICS 2023 Visit trinamiX at LASER World of PHOTONICS 2023 Thursday, 15 June 2023 As in previous years, we'll be packing our demo kits and return to Munich for LASER World of PHOTONICS - the world's leading platform for the laser and photonics industry. From June 27 to 30 , our team will present exciting innovations that we are driving in the fields of biometrics and spectroscopy. In of biometrics, visitors of our booth 520 in hall A3 will experience trinamiX Face Authentication – running on an Android-based smartphone reference design and mounted invisibly behind its display. The solution introduces a new gold standard for biometric authentication by not only erasing the need for a notch or punchhole but also fulfilling the industry's highest security standards. We're further showcasing our face authentication as part of novel automotive solutions : The Driver Identification Display developed with Continental for driver authentication inside the cabin, and the Vehicle Access System developed with Antolin for a frictionless access and protection against theft. On the spectroscopy side, we're premiering exciting novelties around our latest breakthroughs in business and consumer solutions . Visit our booth to learn all about our next-generation handheld NIR spectrometer trinamiX PAL Two that will complement our successful Mobile NIR Spectroscopy Solutions . Giving an outlook into the future, our team will also demonstrate how we are taking the miniaturization of NIR spectroscopy a huge step further by seamlessly integrating the proven technology into smartphones and wearables. Arrange a meeting If you are interested in learning more about our technologies or are looking for ways to partner with us, please don't hesitate to arrange a meeting with our experts in Munich. Just share your contact details with us and let us know your availabilities and field of interest in the description field, and we will reach out to you shortly.

    "trinamiX joins Qualcomm Software Accelerator Program Next-generation of facial recognition: trinamiX joins Qualcomm Software Accelerator Program February 25, 2020 trinamiX has joined the Qualcomm Software Accelerator Program to enable its patented technology for 'live skin' detection as the new goldstandard for facial recognition across mobile devices. Through this new collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies, OEM customers will now be able to use the trinamiX proprietary 'Beam Profile Analysis' technology, which extracts 3 data streams from a single camera system: a 2D IR image, a 3D depth map, and most uniquely – material classification. With this fundamentally new approach to security, it is now possible to combine standard facial-recognition algorithms from any 3rd party with the unique ability to sense 'live skin'. This eliminates the ability to fool the phone into unlocking via a mask, a high-resolution print, or even a 3D rendering of the rightful owner's facial features. Our patented technology enables an industry-leading, secure, and robust facial recognition solution for devices ranging from smartphones to laptops and up to securing access control systems. \"Qualcomm Technologies has always differentiated its product line through a unique blend of raw performance combined with industry-leading features demanded by the most innovative mobile device OEMs,†says Manvinder Singh, Vice President, Product Management, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \"We are very excited to be working with trinamiX and look forward to trinamiX getting this novel technology into the hands of customers at the earliest possible opportunity.†We are excited about this development and are looking forward to the next steps in collaboration with Qualcomm!
