    "ABOUT Us WildFaces.ai is the world's ONLY \"on-the-move\" vision-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) software system. This patented technology can recognize and track faces anonymously from moving cameras, utilizing many of today's IoT devices, such as drones, walking robots, PTZ cameras, mobile phones, body-worn cameras, and more. WildFaces technology only requires ONE low-resolution camera to be able to recognize hundreds of faces in real time in uncontrolled environments at far distances, replacing 50 fixed high-resolution cameras from other traditional facial recognition systems. Our system can recognize and track 50 times more faces, covering 10 times wider areas with just 1/5 of the computation ; making WildFaces highly cost-effective, in fact, 20 times cheaper than others.

    "Automated Access Management for Logistics/ Distribution Centres during a Pandemic All major Retail organizations have to manage access for trucks that bring in goods and take them away both from their distribution centres and from their stores. During a pandemic one has to be able to manage this access without requiring the drivers of the truck to get out of their vehicle at the entrance to check in and without requiring them to touch screens or other equipment. PSIM versus ASAP – the Automated PSIM Physical security information management (PSIM) is a category of software designed to integrate multiple unconnected security applications and devices and control them through one comprehensive user interface. It collects and correlates events from existing disparate security devices and information systems (video, access control, sensors, analytics, networks, building systems, etc.) to empower personnel to identify and resolve situations.",
