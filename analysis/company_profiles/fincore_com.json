Public and Professional Service Delivery Solutions Many public services from allocation of social housing or other social services and benefits all the way to business oriented services such planning permission or the granting and monitoring of operating licenses for certain types of business all require non routine case based working involving several professionals and often even several departments or even organisations. This is very different from standardised routine service processes like those provided by bank teller staff, check-in desks or common sales and customer service help desks. One of the main challenges for case based public services is that each case has some unique aspects and requires the professional skills and judgment of the case worker and other professionals involved. Another key challenge is the fact that case based work frequently requires several agencies or organisations to deliver a joined up and co-ordinated service under tight time and budget contraints to achieve the required outcomes. At the same time service users and the public expect both fair treatment and transparency of decisions especially where they have a major impact on an individual life, on businesses or the community as a whole. Fincore's Public and Professional Service solution addresses all these challenges and provides a secure, flexible and intuitive platform for case work based services within public and government organisations as well as organisations in the voluntary and and professional services sector facing similar ...",
