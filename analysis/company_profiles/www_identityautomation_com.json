This agreement paves the way for Identity Automation and Dell to work together on services implementations of all types including Identity Management, Stoneware WebNetwork, Linux, Storage and much more. With identity management becoming an ever increasing challenge, especially in a K-12 school system, we chose Novell's Identity Manager to meet this need. We selected Identity Automation as the vendor of choice to plan, and implement Identity Manager in our environment. Identity Automation architects were professional, creative and flexible in helping University of Houston-Downtown implement Single Sign On. Identity Automation were the technical resource and support for our Identity Manager rollout. I have partnered with Identity Automation on several high profile projects over the past five years and they always bring the best technical skills, proven methods and professional follow through to each engagement. There was a time when user expectations were simple. Give them some text, maybe a button or two and they were content. White and black were perfectly good colors. Why would you want pictures cluttering up your 640 x 480 workspace anyway? Many of our customers have found that as the number of critical applications and services increases in their environment, so does the need to deliver them to their users continuously. Additionally, users are demanding more out of the applications, wanting customized views, dynamic data, and ad hoc reporting. As technology evolves we are finding that the methods for application delivery are also evolving. While there are a number of varying technologies such as application streaming and terminal services, the most exciting is the movement of applications into the cloud.",
