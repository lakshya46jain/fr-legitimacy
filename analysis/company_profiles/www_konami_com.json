    "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS What Should I Keep In My Side Deck? Learning how to use your Side Deck can decide whether you win or lose at a tournament. Side Deck basics are easy. You can have up to 15 cards in your Side Deck. After you finish the first Duel in a Match, you can take cards out of your Deck (Main Deck or Extra Deck) and swap them with cards in your Side Deck. At this point, you know what kind of Deck you're playing against. So you can use your Side Deck to fix up your Deck in the middle of the Match, and put in cards that work best against your opponent's Deck. Here are some strong cards to keep in your Side Deck for use against some of the most common theme Decks you'll see these days. Side Decking vs. Lightsworn It's important to stop a Lightsworn Deck from filling up its Graveyard with monsters. Whenever \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer†inflicts damage to your opponent, you can remove 2 monsters in their Graveyard from play. Using this effect to remove Lightsworn monsters from play can prevent your opponent from Summoning \"Judgment Dragon,†which requires 4 different Lightsworn monsters in the Graveyard. You can also remove monsters like \"Judgment Dragon†or \"Celestia, Lightsworn Angel†from the Graveyard to keep your opponent from getting them back in their hand. \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer†also stops your opponent from removing cards in their Graveyard from play, which means they can't use \"Necro Gardna†to block your attacks. If you face a Twilight Deck using \"Chaos Sorcerer,†they can't remove a LIGHT and DARK monster from play to Summon it, either. The card that Lightsworn players fear most is \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror†since it blocks all LIGHT monster effects from working. If your Deck doesn't have many LIGHT monsters in it, you should definitely have 3 \"Light-Imprisoning Mirrors†in your Side Deck, in case you face a Lightsworn Deck. Side Decking vs. Gladiator Beasts \"Mirror of Oaths†is a card from Raging Battle that is very strong against Gladiator Beasts. When your opponent Special Summons a monster from their Deck, you can activate \"Mirror of Oaths†to destroy that monster, plus you get to draw a card! Gladiator Beasts are all about tagging monsters in and out of the Deck, so \"Mirror of Oaths†can stop their combos dead in their tracks. Another good tactic is to stop a Gladiator Beast player from using any of their monster effects. \"Skill Drain†negates the effects of every monster card on the field, so it's another great candidate to use against Gladiator Beasts. Side Decking vs. Blackwings \"Bottomless Trap Hole†is a great card to use against lots of Decks. But even if you don't use it in your Main Deck, consider using 2 copies in your Side Deck to use against Blackwings. Blackwing Decks rely on \"Black Whirlwind†to search for more Blackwings from their Deck. But if you can destroy a Blackwing when it's Summoned (using your \"Bottomless Trap Hole,†for example), your opponent won't get to search for another Blackwing with \"Black Whirlwind.†\"Black Whirlwind†also won't work if the Blackwing monster is flipped face-down when it's Summoned, so you could also try \"Book of Moon†to keep \"Black Whirlwind†from working. Most Blackwing monsters have very low Defense Points too, so you should be able to destroy them in battle with your own monsters. Even if you can't stop \"Black Whirlwind,†you can still stop your opponent's Special Summons with \"Royal Oppression.†Blackwing Duelists can Special Summon 2 or 3 monsters in one turn, but you can stop all that with \"Royal Oppression,†so they'll just have their 1 Normal Summon each turn. You can also try \"Summon Limit,†which stops players from Summoning more than 2 monsters per turn. Blackwing Decks can use their Normal Summon and Special Summon to set up a Tuner and a non-Tuner in the same turn. But if \"Summon Limit†is on the field, they won't be able to Synchro Summon that turn, too. General Side Deck Cards There are many cards that work well against multiple Decks: \"Lightning Vortex†is good against Decks that Special Summon lots of monsters, like Blackwings, Lightsworn, and Zombies. \"Royal Decree†and \"Jinzo†are great if your opponent plays a lot of Trap Cards. \"Dimensional Fissure†and \"Banisher of the Radiance†can beat Graveyard-based Decks. There's a card out there to beat every other card, and using your Side Deck gives you access to the cards you need. Sometimes your Side Deck can get you out of Matches that seem impossible to win, so don't be afraid to use it. Try out lots of different cards in your Side Deck and see what works best for you.",
    "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS Feature Match, Side Event Final: Adam Corn vs. Davin Davara Twelve year-old Davin Davara is having a pretty awesome weekend. Yesterday we interviewed him in the SHONEN JUMP Championship First-Timer article, where he shared his thoughts about his first-ever trip to a SHONEN JUMP Championship. He then went on to win the Dragon Duel tournament later that day, and just this afternoon he was one of four lucky Duelists selected by raffle to compete for a copy of \"Dark End Dragon.†Davara defeated his first opponent in the \"Dark End Dragon†playoffs, winning two Duels straight to move on to the finals. His opponent? Former U.S. National Champion and SHONEN JUMP Championship winner Adam Corn. With Dueling prodigy Davara playing an aggressive Blackwing Deck, and Corn possibly packing his Lightsworn Vayu Deck, this was one Match we just had to feature. Read more… Chris Bowling wins in Austin with his Twilight Deck! Yesterday we saw nearly 500 Duelists compete, and today the final 16 played off to crown one winner. SHONEN JUMP Championship Austin is over, and Texas' own Chris Bowling has won the tournament with his Twilight Deck! Today we saw the final competition between 3 Destiny Hero / Zombie Decks, 2 Alchemist / Chaos Decks, 5 Lightsworn Decks, 3 Twilight Decks, and 3 Blackwing Decks featuring \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor.†Duelists from Texas and all across the country played hard to try and take home top honors. Chris Bowling played his Twilight DARK / Lightsworn Deck well, and fought through four other Duelists today to take first place. Bowling Dueled against 2 Lightsworn Decks (played by Michael Huynh and Chris Bryson) plus Ryan Spicer's Alchemist Chaos Deck before taking on Morandice Black in the Finals. Lightsworn clashed with Twilight, and Twilight reigned victorious as Bowling took a 2-1 win. Congratulations to everyone who came out to compete in SHONEN JUMP Championship Austin, and special kudos to Chris Bowling, our newest SHONEN JUMP Championship winner! Feature Match, Final Round: Morandice Black vs. Chris Bowling Our final Match today features the LIGHT side of the Lightsworn against their DARK side, facing off for the title of SHONEN JUMP Championship winner. Morandice Black is playing a pure Lightsworn Deck, teching copies of \"My Body As A Shield,†\"Lightning Vortex,†and \"Phantom of Chaos\" in his Main Deck. Bowling is playing a Twilight Deck with \"Chaos Sorcerer†as his DARK monster of choice, plus \"Burial From a Different Dimension\" and \"Shiny Black \"Câ€.†The Sorcerers, Vortex, and \"My Body As A Shields†should be especially good against a pure Lightsworn Deck, so they could be game-breakers.

Read more… Feature Match, Top 8: Chris Bowling vs. Ryan Spicer In 2006, Ryan Spicer went undefeated in the Swiss Rounds of the first SHONEN JUMP Championship held in Austin! This weekend he's repeated that feat, and now he's three wins away from his second SHONEN JUMP Championship win. He's playing the Alchemist / Chaos Deck he himself created. But his opponent is Chris Bowling, another Texan great! The 2008 U.S. National Champion, Bowling finished 8-1 yesterday with his Twilight Deck. Of 3 Twilight Decks that made it to Day 2, Bowling is the only one still in contention. He teched two copies of \"Shiny Black \"Câ€â€ from Ancient Prophecy in his Main Deck, but those cards wouldn't help him here.

Sager narrowly claimed victory, but Lewis was looking for a different outcome in this rematch. Read more…",
    "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS Feature Match, Round 9: Andrew Fredella vs. Ryan Spicer For the ninth and final Round of this event, seated at Table 1 are two undefeated Duelists: Ryan Spicer and Andrew Fredella. Both are past SHONEN JUMP Championship winners, and Spicer is one of the ten bounty players in today's event. Whoever won here would score 20 booster packs of Ancient Prophecy – either Spicer would keep his hoard or Fredella would walk away with a day's worth of packs. Spicer is playing Chaos, while Fredella is playing Blackwings. Spicer opened the Match with a hand of \"Book of Moon,†\"Allure of Darkness,†\"Destiny Hero – Malicious,†\"Brain Control,†\"Dimensional Alchemist,†and \"Smashing Ground.†He Set Book, but lost it to \"Mystical Space Typhoon†next turn. Fredella attacked with \"Blackwing – Bora the Spear,†and ended by Setting a Spell or Trap. Spicer drew \"Dark Armed Dragon,†activated \"Allure of Darkness,†and removed his \"Destiny Hero – Malicious.†He Summoned \"Dimensional Alchemist,†which could let him get that Malicious back, and then removed \"Sangan†from the top of his Deck to boost up the Alchemist. The Alchemist attacked Bora, and Fredella activated the effect of \"Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow.†That destroyed Alchemist, and its effect let Spicer take back his Malicious. In Main Phase 2 he stripped \"Heavy Storm†out of his Deck with \"Gold Sarcophagus,†and he tried to destroy Bora with \"Smashing Ground†– Fredella Chained \"My Body As A Shieldâ€! Spicer Set a Spell or Trap and Fredella Summoned \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor†to attack with it! Bora attacked and Fredella ended. Spicer searched his Deck for \"Dark Grepher†with \"Reinforcement of the Army,†Normal Summoned it, then discarded Malicious for Grepher's effect, sending \"Plaguespreader Zombie†to his Graveyard. He removed Malicious from his Graveyard, Special Summoned another from his Deck, then Special Summoned \"Plaguespreader Zombie†to Tune it to Malicious and Synchro Summon \"Colossal Fighter.†The Fighter attacked Bora, \"Dark Grepher†destroyed Vayu, and Fredella was down to 4400 Life Points. Another Set card in the back row ended Spicer's turn. Fredella tried to Special Summon \"Dark Armed Dragon,†but Spicer negated the Summon with \"Solemn Judgmentâ€! Fredella had two cards left, and he Set one of them to his back row. \"Heavy Storm†ended it all just moments later. A desperate attempt to pull out of a rough hand with \"Dark Armed Dragon†runs aground on \"Solemn Judgment,†as Ryan Spicer takes Game 1! His seat in Day 2 was guaranteed, but there were still 20 packs of Ancient Prophecy (plus a ton of bragging rights) on the line. Fredella seemed even less enthused about his hand this time than he did in the last Duel. Once again, he opened with Bora and Set a card to his Spell & Trap Card Zone. Spicer had \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†\"Book of Moon,†\"Chaos Sorcerer,†\"Allure of Darkness,†\"Destiny Draw,†and \"Dimensional Alchemist.†He activated Allure, drawing \"Card Trooper†and \"Dark Grepher†before removing \"Dark Grepher†to complete Allure's effect. He Normal Summoned Alchemist, removed \"Breaker the Magical Warrior†to boost up Alchemist's ATK, and spectators reeled when the Breaker was revealed. \"Just call it skill!†joked Spicer. He attacked over Bora, Set a Spell or Trap, and Fredella tried to attack with \"Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame†next turn. Spicer turned it face-down with \"Book of Moon,†and Summoned \"Card Trooper†next turn. Alchemist destroyed Shura, \"Card Trooper†attacked for 1900 damage, and play was to Fredella. Fredella Normal Summoned \"Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn,†attacked \"Card Trooper,†and Spicer drew a card with its effect. Fredella Set a second card to his back row. Spicer sent \"Smashing Ground†with Alchemist, turned Alchemist to defense, Set \"Mystical Space Typhoon†and \"Bottomless Trap Hole,†and lost both of those cards to \"Icarus Attack in the End Phaseâ€! Fredella Summoned another Bora, attacked through Alchemist for 1500 damage, and Spicer returned Breaker to his hand. Fredella activated \"Trap Dustshoot†next turn! Spicer revealed \"Caius the Shadow Monarch,†\"Breaker the Magical Warrior,†\"Chaos Sorcerer,†\"Destiny Draw,†\"Plaguespreader Zombie,†and \"Dust Tornado.†\"That's not a great hand, but it's still kind of a problem,†remarked Fredella. He sent \"Chaos Sorcerer†back to Spicer's Deck, since Spicer had Alchemist and \"Dark Armed Dragon†in his Graveyard. Spicer Summoned \"Breaker the Magical Warrior,†attacked Bora, and Fredella activated \"Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow's†effect! Breaker was destroyed and Spicer dropped to 3700 Life Points. \"You gonna set that \"Dust Tornado?â€â€ Spicer did indeed Set it. Fredella hit him with Bora and \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer†next turn. Spicer drew \"Heavy Storm†and conceded, knowing he couldn't fight back. We were moving to Duel 3! Spicer started things off with two \"Dimensional Alchemistsâ€, \"Allure of Darkness,†\"Plaguespreader Zombie,†\"Dust Tornado,†and \"Destiny Hero – Malicious.†He activated Allure, drew \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter†and \"Legendary Jujitsu Master,†and removed Malicious. He Set Jujitsu, Set \"Dust Tornado,†and attacked with Bora into Jujitsu next turn. Fredella Set two cards to his back row. Spicer summoned \"Breaker the Magical Warrior,†destroyed Fredella's face-down \"Mirror Force†with its effect, and attacked for 1600 damage. Fredella ran it over with Bora next turn, Set \"My Body As A Shield,†and lost it to \"Dust Tornado.†Spicer Normal Summoned \"Dimensional Alchemist,†sent \"Brain Control†from his Deck to his 'removed zone' with Alchemist's effect, and Bora attacked Alchemist. Spier took back Malicious. Next turn Spicer had \"Desitny Draw†to discard Malicious. Fredella passed, Spicer Summoned \"Card Trooper,†and lost Trooper and Jujitsu to \"Icarus Attack.†Fredella Normal Summoned Kycoo, attacked to remove \"Dimensional Alchemist†and Malicious, and Set a card to his Spell & Trap Card Zone. Spicer Set a monster, set a back row card, and ended. \"Is that a Jujitsu?†\"Of course not†replied Spicer, grinning and sounding shady. Fredella attacked, hit \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter,†and lost his Set \"Icarus Attack†to Ryko's effect. Spicer was up. He Normal Summoned \"Dimensional Alchemist,†removed Krebons from his Deck to boost Alchemist's ATK, and traded off in battle with Kycoo to take back his Malicious. Fredella passed again, with just three cards in hand. Spicer drew to seven, with another card Set in his Spell & Trap Card Zone. He discarded Malicious to Special Summon \"Dark Grepher.†\"Do you have game?†asked Fredella. \"I do,†replied Spicer, who was still playing out his turn, putting \"Dark Armed Dragon†and a flurry of monsters onto the table that resulted in a \"Stardust Dragon.†Fredella was already packing up, trusting Spicer that he was the victor. Ryan Spicer goes undefeated here today, winning a spot in the Top 16 tomorrow as well as a sweet pile of Ancient Prophecy Booster Packs!",
    "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS 3rd Place Feature Match: Desmond Brown vs. George Murray The playoffs for 3 rd place would pit George Murray's Blackwing Deck against Desmond Brown's Destiny Hero Zombie Deck. This was a common match-up in today's tournament and the result here may help to define the future tournament scene. Brown won the dice roll and chose to begin the Duel. He activated \"Allure of Darkness†and removed \"Destiny Hero – Diamond Dude†from play. He Set one monster and one back row before ending his turn. Murray opened up with \"D.D. Crow,†\"Blackwing – Bora the Spear,†\"Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame,†\"Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn,†and \"Mystical Space Typhoon.†He drew \"Allure of Darkness†as his sixth card. Murray activated \"Mystical Space Typhoon†to destroy Brown's Set \"Torrential Tribute,†then used \"Allure of Darkness†to draw a second \"D.D. Crow†and a \"Brain Control.†He removed Bora from play with Allure. Next, he Summoned \"Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame†and used it to attack \"Goblin Zombie.†Murray recruited Vayu to the field in attack mode with Shura's effect, and Brown added \"Zombie Master†to his hand with the effect of \"Goblin Zombie.†Vayu attacked directly for 800, and Brown dropped to 7200 Life Points. Murray passed his turn without a back row. Brown Summoned \"Zombie Master†next turn and discarded \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†targeting \"Goblin Zombie†with the Master's effect. Murrray chained \"D.D. Crow†to remove the \"Goblin Zombie†from play instead! Brown activated \"Allure of Darkness†next, drawing 2 cards and removing a \"Dark Grepher†from the game. Next, he played \"Foolish Burial†to send a \"Mezuki†from his Deck to his Graveyard. He then attacked Vayu with \"Zombie Master,†and Murray dropped to 7000 Life Points. Brown Set a card and ended his turn. Murray top decked \"Icarus Attack.†Then he paid 800 Life Points to activate \"Brain Control†and took control of Brown's \"Zombie Master.†Both monsters attacked Brown directly, and Brown dropped down to 2600 Life Points. In his second Main Phase, Murray Tributed \"Zombie Master†for \"Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn†and Set \"Icarus Attack.†Brown removed \"Mezuki†from play to Special Summon \"Zombie Master.†Then he discarded a \"Destiny Hero – Malicious†to try to Special Summon \"Plaguespreader Zombie†from his Graveyard, but Murray removed it by using his last in-hand card: \"D.D. Crowâ€! Next, Brown removed Malicious from his Graveyard to Special Summon another one from his Deck. Finally, Brown flipped his one face-down card, \"Return from the Different Dimensionâ€! He Special Summoned Malicious, \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†and \"Goblin Zombie†by paying half of his Life Points. Murray activated his \"Icarus Attack†by Tributing Shura to destroy \"Zombie Master†and \"Plaguespreader Zombie†before Brown could Synchro Summon. Next, Brown played \"Burial from a Different Dimension†and returned \"Mezuki,†\"Dark Grepher,†and Diamond Dude to his Graveyard. Then he removed \"Mezuki†to Special Summon \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†Synchro Summoned \"Stardust Dragon†by Tuning Malicious with \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†and activated \"Book of Life†to bring back the \"Plaguespreader Zombie†again. He tuned \"Goblin Zombie†with \"Plaguespreader Zombie†and Synchro Summoned \"Goyo Guardian.†He then searched for \"Mezuki†with \"Goblin Zombie's†effect. Next, Brown put the \"Mezuki†he searched for on top of his Deck to return \"Plaguespreader Zombie†to the field. He tuned \"Plaguespreader Zombie†to his last Malicious and Summoned \"Colossal Fighter.†All 3 monsters attacked, and the 1 Sirocco on Murray's field wasn't enough to protect him. A huge play made possible by \"Return from the Different Dimension†suddenly turns the game around and gives Desmond Brown the win! George Murray would begin the second Duel. Murray started with 2 \"Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame,†\"Icarus Attack,†\"Waboku,†\"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer,†and \"Royal Oppression†in his opening. He Summoned Shura and Set \"Royal Oppression†along with \"Waboku†before ending his turn. Brown opened up with \"Allure of Darkness†to draw 2 cards and remove \"Mystic Tomato†from the game. Next, he Set one monster and one back row card before ending his turn. Murray drew \"Torrential Tribute†next turn. He attacked Brown's face-down \"Goblin Zombie†with Shura and recruited Kalut to the field with Shura's effect. Brown searched for \"Plaguespreader Zombie†with the effect of \"Goblin Zombie†and added it to his hand. Murray forgot to attack with Kalut and went straight to Main Phase 2 where he Summoned Kycoo. He ended his turn. Brown activated \"Lightning Vortex†by discarding \"Destiny Draw.†All of Murray's monsters were destroyed! Next, Brown Set a monster and ended his turn. Murray played \"Mystical Space Typhoon†to destroy Brown's \"Bottomless Trap Hole,†then Summoned Shura and attacked a \"Plaguespreader Zombie.†Shura recruited Kalut to the field and then Murray attacked directly with it. Brown dropped to 6600 Life Points. Murray Set \"Icarus Attack†in his back row and ended his turn. Brown Summoned \"Zombie Master†next turn. He used it to attack Kalut, and Murray flipped Waboku. Kalut was saved! Next, Brown activated \"Burial from a Different Dimension†to return \"Mystic Tomato†to his Graveyard and try to Special Summon \"Dark Armed Dragon.†But Murray negated the Summon with \"Royal Oppressionâ€! Next turn, Murray attacked with Shura into \"Zombie Master†so both monsters were destroyed, and attacked directly with Kalut dropping Brown to 5200. Brown drew a card and Set one card to his back row. Murray attacked with Kalut next turn and ended his turn without making any major play. On the following turn, Brown Set a monster and ended his turn immediately. Murray drew and Summoned Shura next turn, but Brown activated his face-down \"Bottomless Trap Holeâ€! Murray chained \"Icarus Attack†to target and destroy Brown's face-down \"Necro Gardna†and \"Bottomless Trap Hole.†Brown Set another card next turn, and on his following turn, Murray Summoned a monster and lost his field to \"Torrential Tribute.†Brown passed his next turn without a play. Next turn, Murray had no cards in hand when he drew \"Allure of Darkness.†He activated it and removed a DARK monster, then used another one that he drew and removed Sirocco from the game. He Summoned Kalut and attacked. Brown took the damage. Next turn, Brown passed without playing any cards, and Murray attacked with another Kalut. The attack was negated by \"Necro Gardna.†One turn later, Brown Set his hand and then activated \"Allure of Darkness.†He didn't draw any DARK monsters and was forced to discard his entire hand. When play passed back to Murray, Kalut declared an attack and was blocked by \"Necro Gardna.†Brown activated 2 copies of \"Book of Life†and had them negated by Oppression on his next turn, then used \"Brain Control†to try to take control of Kalut and threaten Murray's remaining Life Points. But Murray chained \"Icarus Attack†to Tribute Kalut and target Brain Control and one of his Set copies of \"Icarus Attack.†Next turn, Brown Summoned Stratos and searched for Diamond Dude. Stratos got hit by \"Trap Hole†and was sent to the Graveyard. Murray drew another \"Royal Oppression†on the following turn and passed without making a play. Brown Summoned Diamond Dude next turn and lost it to another \"Trap Hole.†Next turn, Murray activated \"Black Whirlwind,†Summoned Bora, and searched his deck for Blizzard with Whirlwind's effect. Bora attacked but was blocked by \"Necro Gardna†after Brown activated Burial to return 2 copies of \"Necro Gardna†to his Graveyard. Brown activated \"Heavy Storm†next turn to clear the Spell and Trap Zones, then returned Plaguespreader to the field by putting a card on top of his Deck. Next turn, Murray Summoned Blizzard, activated the effect to revive Shura, and Synchro Summoned \"Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrierâ€! He pitched a card from his hand to bounce \"Plaguespreader Zombie†and Brown conceded. Brown would begin the third Duel. The winner here would receive a \"Dark End Dragon†prize card! Brown activated \"Destiny Draw†and discarded \"Destiny Hero – Diamond Dude†to draw 2 more cards. Then he Set a card to each zone and ended his turn. Murray started with 2 copies of \"Icarus Attack,†\"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North,†\"Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow,†and \"Black Whirlwind.†He drew \"Royal Oppression†on his first turn. Murray activated \"Black Whirlwind†and Set a \"Royal Oppression†to his back row. He Summoned Kalut next, but lost it to \"Torrential Tribute.†Brown's \"Necro Gardna†was destroyed too. On his next turn, Brown cleared the field with \"Heavy Stormâ€! Then he Summoned \"Mystic Tomato†and attacked directly. He ended his turn without setting a back row. Murray Summoned \"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North†next turn and used its effect to revive Kalut. He Set a card before play passed back to Brown. On his next turn, Brown attacked Blizzard with \"Mystic Tomato,†Set a card to his Spell and Trap Zone, and ended his turn. Murray used his next turn only to Set 2 cards to his back row. Brown attacked Kalut with \"Mystic Tomato†next turn, and Murray activated \"Mirror Forceâ€! He ended his turn. Murray drew \"Torrential Tribute†next turn, switched Kalut into attack mode, and attacked. Brown took the damage and lost 1400 Life Points. Brown drew a card and Set a monster before passing. On Murray's next turn, he attacked with Kalut but had his attack negated by Necro Gardna. He finished his turn by setting a fourth card to his back row. Brown Tributed his face-down \"Necro Gardna†for \"Caius the Shadow Monarch†next turn, targeting Kalut with Caius's effect, and Murray chained \"Icarus Attack†to destroy Caius and a face-down \"Bottomless Trap Hole.†Murray drew a card and passed his next turn without making a play, and then Brown drew a card and Set 1 back row before passing. Murray drew a card, Set a back row, and passed the following turn too. Things got more exciting on Brown's next turn. Brown activated \"Destiny Draw†by discarding Malicious to draw 2 cards. Then he activated \"Book of Life†and Special Summoned \"Plaguespreader Zombie†from his Graveyard by removing a Blizzard from Murray's Graveyard. He also removed a Malicious from his Graveyard to Special Summon another one from his Deck. Murray flipped \"Torrential Tribute†when the Malicious was Summoned, but Brown chained \"My Body as a Shield†to protect his monsters. Brown Tuned \"Plaguespreader Zombie†with Malicious to Synchro Summon \"Stardust Dragon.†\"Stardust Dragon†attacked and Murray dropped to 4000 life. Brown Set another card next turn and now had 3 face-down Spell or Trap Cards. On Murray's next turn, he Set a card to each zone and ended his turn. Brown played \"Allure of Darkness†next turn to draw 2 cards and remove Gorz from play. Then he activated \"Reinforcement of the Army†to search his Deck for \"Necro Gardna.†He Summoned \"Zombie Master†and discarded \"Necro Gardna†with priority. Murray flipped \"Trap Hole†and \"Zombie Master†was destroyed. \"Stardust Dragon†attacked, but Waboku protected Murray's face-down Bora. Brown ended. Murray Set another Bora face-down before ending his next turn. Brown Summoned another \"Zombie Master†after play passed back to him. He used \"Stardust Dragon†to attack, but Murray Tributed Bora with \"Icarus Attack.†Brown Tributed Stardust to negate it, and then \"Zombie Master†attacked Murray's face-down monster. Brown flipped \"Waboku†to protect his face-down Bora. On Brown's End Phase, he brought back \"Stardust Dragon.†Then Murray activated another \"Icarus Attack,†Tributing his other Bora. He didn't realize that \"Stardust Dragon†would be able to use its effect again. \"Stardust Dragon†negated the \"Icarus Attackâ€! Brown had 3 back rows with a \"Stardust Dragon†and \"Zombie Master†on the field, while Murray had only 1 Shura in his hand and no cards on the field. On Murray's next turn, he was delighted to draw a \"Dark Armed Dragon†with exactly 3 DARK monsters in his Graveyard. He Special Summoned it and then Normal Summoned Shura. Shura was destroyed by Brown's set \"Trap Hole.†\"Dark Armed Dragon†tried to attack, but Brown flipped \"Threatining Roar.†On his next turn Brown activated \"Brain Control†to take control of \"Dark Armed Dragon†and Murray scooped up his cards. In a narrow 2-1 victory, Desmond Brown has become the proud owner of a \"Dark End Dragon†SHONEN JUMP Championship Prize Card! Post-Event Analysis! See what our expert had to say about this Duel after the event was over. Michael Kohanim (2009 World Championship Competitor) Desmond Brown did a great job playing around \"Icarus Attack†throughout the Match. He never committed too many cards to the field when he didn't need to, which gave Murray fewer targets to destroy with it. At one point, he forced Murray to destroy one of his own cards. At another point, he got Murray to target a face-down \"Necro Gardna†and an already-flipped \"Bottomless Trap Hole†with \"Icarus Attack.†\"Stardust Dragon†also provided Brown with a great counter to Murray's multiple copies of \"Icarus Attack.† to check out the next Feature Match.",
    "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS The End of Day 2, and Our New SHONEN JUMP Champion! It's over, and our newest SHONEN JUMP Champion is Spain's Rodrigo Togores! A total of 673 Duelists threw down this weekend, and by the time the field was narrowed to a Top 16, we had six Deck types in contention. Blackwings, Synchro Cat, Destiny Hero Zombies, Twilight, and even a Deck built around \"Sky Scourge Norleras†made Day 2, but more than half the field was occupied by classic Lightsworn Decks! With nine Lightsworn builds in the Top 16 it seemed like a victory could be in the cards for Lightsworn. But once again it was not to be. Rodrigo Togores exploded through his opponents with an ambitious Blackwing Deck, starring Ancient Prophecy's new card: \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor.†While many Duelists tried to take Blackwings in a new direction with \"Burial From a Different Dimension,†Togores relied on \"Black Whirlwind†instead, which won him Duel after Duel all weekend long. Congratulations to everyone who came out to compete here in Orlando, and special congrats to Rodrigo Togores, your new SHONEN JUMP Championship winner! The Finals: Rodrigo Togores versus Herman Herrera Rodrigo Togores traveled from Europe this weekend with his sights set on leaving Orlando as SHONEN JUMP Championship winner! Packing a Blackwing Deck with two copies of \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor,†Togores chose not to run \"Burial From a Different Dimension,\" a popular card for many other Blackwing Duelists that played in this tournament. \"Black Whirlwind\" has paid off hugely for Togores all weekend long, and now he's just two wins away from capturing the Championship. But his opponent is Herman Herrera, bringing the tournament's most successful Vayu Turbo Deck to the Finals! A lot of Duelists doubted the power of this \"Armageddon Knight\" / \"Dark Grepher\" Blackwing Deck, but Herrera has delivered on the hype, and smashed opponent after opponent to claim his place in the finals! Read more… Top 4 Feature Match: Rodrigo Togores versus Glenn Lightfoot Four Duelists remain in this tournament: two playing Lightsworn and two playing Blackwings! Both of the Top 4 matches pit Blackwings against Lightsworn, so depending on what happens here we could see two different Decks in the finals, or any one of the two possible mirror matches. Cool stuff! Rodrigo Togores traveled here this weekend all the way from Spain, where he is the 2009 National Champion! Togores is playing a Blackwing-heavy Deck packing two copies of \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor,†but no copies of \"Burial From a Different Dimension.†Glenn Lightfoot is running Lightsworn, with three copies of \"Beckoning Light\" in his Main Deck. With copies of \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer,†\"Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid,†and \"My Body as a Shield†in his Side Deck, Lightfoot may have an advantage in the second and third Duels. Read more… Top 8 Feature Match: Paul Clarke versus Herman Herrera With eight Duelists left in the round, we had 4 Lightsworn, 2 Blackwing, 1 Twilight, and 1 DARK Norleras Deck still in contention. This round we'll see Herman Herrera take his Blackwing – Vayu Deck against Paul Clarke's Lightsworn Deck. The winner here would move on to the Top 4, where he would have two chances to take home a \"Dark End Dragon.†Read more… Top 16 Feature Match: Chris Digregorio versus James Laurent Our first feature match of the day will pit New York's Chris Digregorio against Florida's own James Laurent! Digregorio made it to Day 2 with a Synchro Cat Deck, a Deck that was very popular last format but was hit by the new September 1 Forbidden & Limited Cards List. His opponent James Laurent is playing a DARK combo Deck based around \"Sky Scourge Norleras,†a Deck we've never seen in Day 2 contention before. This was going to be good! Read more… Welcome to Day 2 of SHONEN JUMP Championship Orlando, Florida Yesterday we saw 673 Duelists duke it out in ten rounds of intense Dueling, and now just sixteen competitors remain! Six different Decks are in contention here today, with slightly more than half of the field representing Lightsworn. In addition, we'll see Twilight, Blackwing – Vayu Decks, Synchro Cat, Destiny Hero Zombies, and even \"Sky Scourge Norleras†in the Top 16! Lightsworn has the power of sheer numbers behind it, and we may finally see a Lightsworn victory at a SHONEN JUMP Championship here today. But the other five strategies all fought through Lightsworn matchups yesterday, and proved that they could take them down. Any of these Decks are capable of winning here today, and with four rounds remaining in this tournament it's impossible to find a favorite this early. Welcome to the last rounds of the first big tournament of this format! Welcome, to Day 2 of SHONEN JUMP Championship Orlando! The end of Day 1 Day 1 is over, and 673 Duelists have been reduced to a final 16 competitors. Surprises abound today, but one result was not a surprise at all: Lightsworn are the most populous Deck to beat here in Orlando! Day 2 competition will see six different Decks play off tomorrow morning: 2 Destiny Hero / Zombie Decks, 1 DARK \"Sky Scourge Norleras†build, 1 Synchro Cat variant, 1 Twilight Deck, 2 Blackwing variants packing \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor,†and a whopping 9 Lightsworn Decks will go head-to-head tomorrow! The numbers are in Lightsworn's favor, but the other Decks in the Top 16 got to where they are tonight by defeating Lightsworn Duelist after Lightsworn Duelist, all day long. This one is anybody's game. Will this be the tournament when the Lightsworn finally take home the gold? Or will we see a different Deck beat the odds and win the title? Join us tomorrow morning at 10 AM to find out, as we prepare for Day 2 of SHONEN JUMP Championship Orlando! Top 16 Decklists – Orlando, Florida Here's a look at the Top 16 Decklists from today. Read more… Round 10 Feature Match: Rodrigo Togores versus Daniel Brown Each of these Duelists has already appeared in a feature match today, but this matchup was too good to pass up. Read more… Round 9 Feature Match: Daniel Brown versus Herman Herrera Daniel Brown is playing one of the more unusual Decks at the top tables. The Deck list reads like half a Lightsworn Deck and half a Blackwing Deck, stuck together. It's weird, but it seems to work – Brown is 7-1 going into this round. His opponent here in Round 8 is Herman Herrera, playing \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor\" with \"Charge of the Light Brigade.†This is a tough match to predict the outcome for, and it'll be interesting to see how these Decks do against each other. Neither player had knowledge of what his opponent was playing. Read more…"
