    "1st European Olympic Games BACKGROUND The Baku 2015 First European Games were the inaugural edition of the European Games, an international multi-sport event for athletes representing the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the European Olympic Committees. It took place in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 12 to 28 June 2015, and featured almost 6,000 athletes from 50 countries competing in 30 sports. Many new venues were purpose-built for the event, including the 68,000-capacity Baku National Stadium. It formed the centerpiece of the Games and held the opening ceremonies. The Baku 2015 First European Games entailed: 253 medal events over 17 days 50 countries taking part 18 competition venues 6 temporary arenas CHALLENGE The Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan required the following: Ensuring the safety and security of all spectators, players, officials, and any person present at a stadium hosting a European Games event Risk assessments for all events including any secondary activities, such as opening or award ceremonies Advice and guidance to senior national government security officials Pre-event inspections for security deficiencies and emergency contingency plans. Data on attendance figures for each event Development methods to curb ticket counterfeiting Centralization of surveillance operations Access control for stadiums and other venues related to the European Games Updating of existing surveillance hardware Training for security agents Incident reporting Enforcing adherence to maximum capacity for venues Establishing of restricted access zones Security checks carried out on persons and vehicles at the entry points of the outer and inner perimeters S OLUTION Prilyx was responsible for the design and delivery of a complete security solution for the Ministry of National Security Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The project was executed in a duration of 18 months, with a total budget of around $25 million. Prilyx acted as the main security advisor to the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan, as well as working with the Ministry of Youth and Sport and the First Lady's Olympic Committee, the Baku European Games Operating Committee, BEGOC. The Prilyx solution was centered on biometrics, tracking, video analytics and as well as hardware installation and project management. The solution provided organizers with an unprecedented level of security for the various venues that hosted more than 250,000 attendees, 6,000 athletes, 50 countries, and 20 events. Working closely with event organizers, Prilyx's biometrics and tracking solution covered all major traffic areas: the Olympic Stadium, the National Gymnastics Arena, the Crystal Hall Arena, and all event venues throughout the city. The biometrics platform provided attendee visibility and traceability in real time from a central security control site, thus ensuring security for the event, the attendees and the athletes. In addition, the solution delivered real-time, actionable information so security personnel could respond quickly to any situation. Prilyx's solution integrated seamlessly with existing on-site security systems.

    "Facial Recognition: Technology Rooted in History December 6, 2017 By: Fardin Barekat, BASc The process of seeing a person and knowing who they are, commonly referred to as identification, is a non-trivial process which is taken for granted amongst humans, having adopted this skill naturally along their evolutionary process. Throughout human history, this ability to identify other people has been employed indirectly, for example through portraits, and has been done so for activities ranging from the arts, to entertainment all the way through to law enforcement. The twenty first century stands at the precipice, in danger of becoming a cold world dominated by the spectre of biometric invasion and not only lacking personal privacy, but even denying private identity. Among other things, it is the growing trend of the proliferation of social media sources and Internet of Things devices that is blamed for this steady erosion of personal privacy by such practices as biometric identification. It will, therefore, come as a surprise to most people that the procedural use of facial recognition precedes not only social media, but further the internet, both world wars, and even the invention of the programmable computer. One crucial step towards facial recognition was the invention of the photograph, in the early 1800's, and then the subsequent photographing of criminals beginning in the 1840s. By 1888 with the standardization of this latter photographing, the now famous Mug Shot was created, enabling law enforcement personnel to turn their efforts into interpretation and identification of mug shots. An early form of procedure based facial recognition was the Tableau synoptique des traits physionomiques system invented by Alphonse Bertillon in XXXX. This system, most often used by local law enforcement officers, employed a cheat sheet with a variety of uniquely indexed facial features. Although the Tableau System aided law enforcement activities by creating a common facial code language, by virtue of relying solely on the efforts of examiners, it was wholly non-automated. In 1966 Woody Bledsoe, Helen Chan Wolf, and Charles Bisson created a program which calculated the distances between facial features (ie. Eyes, ears, nose, etc.) which was then compared to reference data. The three pioneers had created the world's first facial recognition program. Their program, however, still relied on an examiner for manual input of the facial feature locations. This requirement, thereby, limited their program to only being a semi-automated facial recognition program. Although improvements were made to this program in the 70's – Goldstein, Harmon, and Lesk employed 21 specific facial features, Kirby and Sirovich employed linear component analysis – these programs still required manual input and, thus, required human interaction. It was not until 1991 that the processing of detecting faces, face detection, was developed. With face detection, the examiner was no longer required for detection of faces, and thus both feature extraction and facial recognition were both fully automated. Therefore, in 1991 the first fully automated facial recognition program was born. And the rest, as they say, is history. Prilyx Research and Development is at the forefront of biometrics research and integration by developing new techniques and algorithms and integrating with other security related systems.
