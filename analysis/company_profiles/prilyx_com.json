    "1st European Olympic Games BACKGROUND The Baku 2015 First European Games were the inaugural edition of the European Games, an international multi-sport event for athletes representing the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the European Olympic Committees. It took place in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 12 to 28 June 2015, and featured almost 6,000 athletes from 50 countries competing in 30 sports. Many new venues were purpose-built for the event, including the 68,000-capacity Baku National Stadium. It formed the centerpiece of the Games and held the opening ceremonies. The Baku 2015 First European Games entailed: 253 medal events over 17 days 50 countries taking part 18 competition venues 6 temporary arenas CHALLENGE The Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan required the following: Ensuring the safety and security of all spectators, players, officials, and any person present at a stadium hosting a European Games event Risk assessments for all events including any secondary activities, such as opening or award ceremonies Advice and guidance to senior national government security officials Pre-event inspections for security deficiencies and emergency contingency plans. Data on attendance figures for each event Development methods to curb ticket counterfeiting Centralization of surveillance operations Access control for stadiums and other venues related to the European Games Updating of existing surveillance hardware Training for security agents Incident reporting Enforcing adherence to maximum capacity for venues Establishing of restricted access zones Security checks carried out on persons and vehicles at the entry points of the outer and inner perimeters S OLUTION Prilyx was responsible for the design and delivery of a complete security solution for the Ministry of National Security Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The project was executed in a duration of 18 months, with a total budget of around $25 million. Prilyx acted as the main security advisor to the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan, as well as working with the Ministry of Youth and Sport and the First Lady's Olympic Committee, the Baku European Games Operating Committee, BEGOC. The Prilyx solution was centered on biometrics, tracking, video analytics and as well as hardware installation and project management. The solution provided organizers with an unprecedented level of security for the various venues that hosted more than 250,000 attendees, 6,000 athletes, 50 countries, and 20 events. Working closely with event organizers, Prilyx's biometrics and tracking solution covered all major traffic areas: the Olympic Stadium, the National Gymnastics Arena, the Crystal Hall Arena, and all event venues throughout the city. The biometrics platform provided attendee visibility and traceability in real time from a central security control site, thus ensuring security for the event, the attendees and the athletes. In addition, the solution delivered real-time, actionable information so security personnel could respond quickly to any situation. Prilyx's solution integrated seamlessly with existing on-site security systems. Designed and deployed nation-wide network for surveillance and tracking including: 200+ biometric/biographic access control kiosks 750+ biometric/analytic surveillance cameras High capacity real-time RF tracking system for 170,000 subjects 1 Petabyte of storage Processing 160 Gbps – 140,000 simultaneous HD camera streams 300 physical servers 600+ workstations Centralized datacenter with 500+ workstations 200 switches, with 2+ million feet of fiber optic across 14 different venues Designed and built control room: 185 professional consoles Command and Control Centre with 50 sq. meter video wall, professional consoles, and full situation room Trained 400+ government employees on system usage and maintenance from four ministries Managed a multi-company group of engineers from Canada, Austria, United States, Switzerland, Azerbaijan, Russia, Germany, Belgium, Poland, Israel and Turkey BENEFITS Prilyx's video solution enabled security guards to upload photos and videos in real-time when reporting an incident, which gave management an instant understanding of what was happening Surveillance cameras monitored crowd behavior Facial recognition capabilities enabled better access control management Eliminated opportunities for fraud and counterfeit tickets Prilyx's tracking was using RFID enhanced badges that helped cost cutting by allowing to reduce staff and increased productivity Allowed staff to cut down on spectator queuing and wait times at entrances Enabled the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan to gather spectator biometric and biographic information for enhanced security and business intelligence.
