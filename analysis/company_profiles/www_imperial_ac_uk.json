Typically, the thickness of mechanically cleaved flakes and chemical vapor deposited thin films is distributed randomly over a large area, where accurate identification of atomic layer numbers is time-consuming. Hyperspectral imaging microscopy yields spectral information that can be used to distinguish the spectral differences of varying thickness specimens. However, its spatial resolution is relatively low due to the spectral imaging nature. In this work, we present a 3D deep learning solution called DALM (deep-learning-enabled atomic layer mapping) to merge hyperspectral reflection images (high spectral resolution) and RGB images (high spatial resolution) for the identification and segmentation of MoS2 flakes with mono-, bi-, tri-, and multilayer thicknesses. DALM is trained on a small set of labeled images, automatically predicts layer distributions and segments individual layers with high accuracy, and shows robustness to illumination and contrast variations. Further, we show its advantageous performance over the state-of-the-art model that is solely based on RGB microscope images.

    "In this section Micro-power sources and bioelectronics integrated 3D soft system The rapid advancement and clinical deployment of bioelectronics systems for biological signal monitoring and therapy have led to an increased need for flexible and soft biomedical electronics. These electronics are specifically designed to seamlessly integrate with 3D dynamically curved biological interfaces. In this context, the development of micro-power sources, integral to these systems, is of paramount importance. These power sources must offer continuous energy supply, minimizing the need for frequent recharging or component replacement. Traditional microelectronics power units, often rigid or bulky, pose challenges such as immunological rejection and trauma, and typically fail to deliver sufficient output power for long-term applications. To effectively address these issues, there is a pressing demand for flexible, high-performance energy storage systems. These systems should not only be capable of conforming to curved bio-interfaces but also ensure long-term stability and reliability for the sustained operation of bioelectronics systems. The integration of such advanced micro-power sources into 3D soft system designs is crucial for the next generation of bioelectronics, offering enhanced compatibility and functionality for a wide range of biomedical applications.
