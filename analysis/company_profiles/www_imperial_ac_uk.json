    "The Environmental Health theme will include identification of pollution sources, impact on human health, monitoring and mitigation strategies, policy and regulation or pollution types such as air pollution and water pollution. The activities in this theme all involve interdisciplinary approaches. For example, air pollution research requires the integration of expertise across a wide range of disciplines from human exposure science, environmental toxicology and epidemiology, atmospheric chemistry and physics, modelling, economics, to social and behavioural sciences; mitigation strategies require engineering innovation and systems monitoring and control. Imperial researchers are working to tackle air pollution and improve air quality for all through the Network of Excellence in Air Quality . From looking at the environmental and social drivers that make people choose to walk in cities to studying the air quality of London's parks and playgrounds and using physics to understand the impact of pollution on personal health in urban environments .",
    "Systems approach to zero pollution In order to avoid the unintended consequences caused by focussing on problems individually instead of considering the wider landscape, this theme links all the other pillars of research in the initiative. By taking a holistic view of the issues of global pollution we will find solutions to address this major societal challenge. We have highlighted some of our research using a systems approach below. The Integrated Development of Low-Carbon Energy Systems (IDLES) programme , hosted by Energy Futures Lab, brings together researchers from across Imperial College to provide the evidence needed to facilitate a cost-effective and secure transition to a low-carbon future. This 5-year, EPSRC-funded programme centres on whole-energy systems analysis; aiming to create a modelling tool that can better coordinate the complex interactions within the energy domain and indicate optimal forms of future, integrated, energy systems to policy makers. Using this approach to plan the UK's future energy system has the potential to enable large cost savings in providing decarbonised energy, to ensure security of supply and compliance with emissions targets. Dr Ana Mijic from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and her colleagues are working on the development of novel approaches to systems analysis of water management. Her research will inform regulators and industry about the role and value of people, cities, natural capital and technological innovations in defining water security and sustainable development under future uncertainties. Dr Mijic is one of the lead researchers on Community Water Management for a Liveable London (CAMELLIA) , a £5m grant from the Natural Environment Research Council. Dr Mijic recently led The Forum's workshop on the water management and flooding . Researchers from across College had discussions with partners from government and other stakeholders to address many of the issues associated with water management and flooding.",
    "This theme focusses on developing the innovative economic and business, policy and community engagement models needed for a sustainable society. Moving to a circular economy To tackle climate change and conserve our planet's resources we need to design for a circular economy and move to a zero waste society. The circular economy is a model of production and consumption which involves reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible. Imperial researchers are working to tackle pollution by looking at the circular economy in areas such as the service industry, new business models, water management, consumer goods, stopping plastic waste from entering the environment, and the construction industry. Design for a circular economy Researchers from the Dyson School of Design Engineering are investigating ways to design for a circular economy. Dr Marco Aurisicchio explores how designers can consider the entire lifecycle of products and configure the systems to produce closed loop material flows. Dr Elena Dieckmann has started a company, Aeropowder, to develop new ways to use waste chicken feathers in sustainable thermally insulating packaging and potentially insulation in construction. Dr Pelin Demirel works on aligning companies' decision-making towards circular outcomes, particularly given the need for urgent innovation in response to new environmental regulation. Read about The Forum 's May 2020 workshop on how to transition to a circular economy . EPSRC Circular Economy Centres Researchers from Imperial are involved with two of UKRI's Interdisciplinary Circular Economy Centres , a £22.5m initiative announced by the Government in November 2020 . The new £4.3m National Interdisciplinary Centre for Circular Chemical Economy led by Loughborough University will develop new transformative technologies to help reduce the chemical industry's environmental impact, with a particular focus on recovering and reprocessing olefins. Academics from the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial will lead work on process integration and whole system analysis as part of the centre. Read the news article about the centre . Dr Rupert Myers from Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering will carry out research as part of the UKRI Interdisciplinary Circular Economy Centre For Mineral-based Construction Materials l ed by University College London. The centre will develop systems for more efficient use and recovery of mineral resources, helping the construction industry to do more with less, reduce waste, lessen pollution, and lower costs. Dr Myers looks at resource flows within the infrastructure sector and leads the infrastructure lifecycles research area in the Centre for Systems Engineering and Innovation. Supporting businesses to adopt sustainable models The Leonardo Centre , led by Professor Maurizio Zollo from Imperial College Business School, has a mission to tackle the two big challenges currently faced by business and the world at large: environmental and social regeneration. Professor Nick Voulvoulis from the Centre for Environmental Policy, researches water in the circular economy and leads the research collaboration with Veolia on the Circular Economy. A new centre for climate change innovation is an initiative of Imperial's Grantham Institute and the Royal Institution to catalyse innovation of all forms that address the causes and effects of climate change. It is backed by six founding members, Arup, the Mayor of London, HSBC UK, Octopus Centre for Net Zero, Pollination and Slaughter and May. There are a number of briefing papers on economics and finance related to climate change and environment issues on the Grantham Institute website.",
    "In this section Zero pollution mobility Tackling transport pollution is a complex challenge that goes beyond tackling exhaust emissions. The focus of the Mobility theme is on all aspects related to the movement of people, goods and services, contributing to the planning, design, operations and management of infrastructures, for the promotion of the health and wellbeing of the planet and its inhabitants. With the zero pollution mobility theme we bring together research threads across Imperial College London that range from radical new technologies to innovative methods of infrastructure operations and management, to novel insights into behaviour change and societal engagement techniques and improved methods for the assessment of impacts. We work with a wide range of external partners across the research, business, government, media and quasi-governmental sectors, and public engagement in different forms is a critical pillar of our research efforts. Theme Champions This theme is led by Dr Audrey de Nazelle (Centre for Environmental Policy), Dr Sean Beevers (School of Public Health) and Dr Aruna Sivakumar (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering).

    "In 2020, the Transition to Zero Pollution initiative formed a second cohort of 12 students from across College carrying out research related to TZP. The students are all aligned with the NERC-funded Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet DTP run by the Grantham Institute. Find out more about the students' projects below. Emma Beirns - Co-metabolism of sulfonamides in anaerobic wastewater treatment incorporating direct interspecies electron transfer Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Supervisor: Dr Po-Heng (Henry) Lee Funder: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and UKRI EPSRC Anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies are already contributing to global sustainability efforts: clean effluent can be used as irrigation water; nutrient-rich sludge can be used as fertiliser; and methane-rich biogas can be used to generate electricity. The recovery of these resources facilitates the transition to zero pollution by curtailing demand for intensive raw production processes. However, the safety of utilising effluent and sludge from biological wastewater treatment plants is being scrutinised due to the presence of antibiotic residues and associated resistance genes. Research has shown that biological wastewater treatment, including anaerobic treatment, can remove >95% of antibiotics, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. This research project is focused on observing the degradation of one class of antibiotics – sulfonamides – in a novel anaerobic fluidised-bed membrane bioreactor (AFMBR). This reactor type has demonstrated high effluent quality at retention times similar to conventional aerobic treatment, however, with the benefit of high pharmaceutical removal and sufficient biogas production to balance operational power demands. This is hypothesised to be due in part to direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) via the granular activated carbon (GAC) media used in AFMBR. By focusing on sulfonamides and determining the associated degradation genes, an investigative method will be developed that may be applicable to other antibiotic classes, leading to further developments in pharmaceutical removal techniques. This will ultimately preserve the utility of the resources contained within wastewater and prevent a return to raw production processes.

The analysis will take place in the context of uncertainties introduced in wildfire management and fire regimes by anthropogenic environmental change; looking at developing effective and sustainable agricultural, forest, and fire management policies to improve resilience to wildfire while maintaining the benefits from natural resource use. A transition to zero pollution requires an understanding of the political ecology of wildfire complexities and uncertainties across all global ecosystems, whilst also considering their role in Earth's climate system due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Sam Hair - Nanoscale design of battery electrodes for improved performance and lifetime Department of Materials Supervisors: Professors Milo Shaffer, Mary Ryan and Magda Titirici Funder: UKRI EPSRC iCASE Award To maintain grid stability, utility companies must ensure that supply of electricity is always matched with demand. Today, this constant balancing act is enabled by the ability of fossil fuels to be burnt on demand: if it isn't very windy, gas is burnt at a faster rate. As fossil fuels on the grid are replaced by renewable energy sources, more grid-scale energy storage will be essential to store excess electricity (generated on the windy days) and then release it at a time of need (when the wind stops). Batteries are one form of grid-scale energy storage. The role of battery electrode structure has been poorly explored in the literature, but nanostructured electrodes in principle offer many advantages including faster charging and higher energy capacity. The goal of this project is to develop optimised anodes for sodium ion batteries that will improve performance and illustrate a design philosophy for other battery chemistries. Sarah Kakadellis - Assessing the suitability of biodegradable bioplastics in food waste anaerobic co-digestion within the Bioeconomy Centre for Environmental Policy Supervisors: Dr Zoe Harris, Dr Jem Woods and Dr Po-Heng (Henry) Lee Funder: UKRI ESRC (LISS DTP) The use of plastics is a contentious issue at the heart of our throwaway society. The recent years have placed plastic pollution under growing public scrutiny, favouring the development of 'greener' plant-based plastic materials. However, such bio-based biodegradable alternatives may not necessarily provide an improvement in overall environmental impact and little is known about their end-of-life management. Adopting an interdisciplinary perspective, this research project explores bioplastics waste management and aims to assess the suitability of biodegradable plastics in the current food waste anaerobic digestion infrastructure and their potential to optimise biogas production from food waste management. To achieve this, chemical and genetic analyses will be performed to characterise the bioplastic-food waste anaerobic system at a macro and micro level, with a further goal to identify genes (and biochemical pathways) associated with bioplastic degradation. The PhD also incorporates social sciences, through semi-structured interviews. Understanding barriers from real-world cases and identifying mismatches in academic research, current waste management infrastructure and the policy landscape will help building a more comprehensive framework for biodegradable plastics within the bioeconomy. Maria Koulouri - Resource Recovery from Faecal Sludge Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Supervisors: Professor Michael Templeton and Dr Geoff Fowler Funder: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Skempton Scholarship The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. However, 4.2 billion people worldwide still do not have access to safely managed sanitation services. Approximately 3.1 billion people rely on pit latrines and other improved on-site sanitation facilities.Excreta from such facilities, known as faecal sludge, can have detrimental environmental impacts if they are not safely managed. This project focuses on the assessment of novel treatment technologies, such as pyrolysis, in order to develop a holistic faecal sludge management approach that provides wider environmental benefits through resource and energy recovery. Resource recovery opportunities from faecal sludge pyrolysis include the production of a nutrient-rich biochar that can be used in agriculture, as a soil amendment. At the same time, the biochar is a carbon-rich material and its efficient application offers carbon sequestration benefits. Sludge derived fuels can be used as a greener alternative to fossil fuels, also contributing to climate change mitigation. Priyanka Kumar - Building a spent grain biorefinery based with low-cost ionic liquids Department of Chemical Engineering Supervisors: Professor Jason Hallett and Dr Agi Brandt-Talbot Funder: Department of Chemical Engineering Spent grain, a biomass residue from brewing, is a major industrial biomass by-product in the UK and worldwide. This project focuses on the application of low-cost ionic liquids to the processing of Brewer's Spent Grain (BSG), to produce biomaterials and value-added products, including proteins. The ionoSolv process will be used to fractionate BSG into cellulose, lignin and protein. IonoSolv pretreatment of biomass is a patented new biomass fractionation process developed at Imperial College (commercialisation by Lixea LTD, www.lixea.co) but has not been optimised for protein-rich lignocellulose such as spent grain. In this project the extraction, recovery and purity of the proteins from spent grain will be optimised, while maximising the quality of the other fractions. Biomaterial and bio-based chemical product options such as lignin carbon fibres and nanocellulose will also be evaluated. Ultimately the aim is to develop greener alternatives to today's petrochemical industry, while providing unwanted waste materials with a new purpose. For example, creating carbon fibres from lignin has the potential to sever fossil fuel dependency of carbon fibre production, reduce the environmental impact of the process and drastically cut its cost by more than 75%. Anthony Onwuli - Rapid computational screening of materials for energy storage Supervisor: Professor Aron Walsh Funder: UKRI EPSRC DTP This PhD project will use materials informatics - a combination of computer science and materials science - to develop software for the rapid screening and identification of new chemical spaces for energy storage. The project will be focused on the substitution of existing components that are formed of non-toxic or rare elements, e.g. LiCoO2 cathodes in high-density Li-ion batteries. Critical to this will be metrics relating to materials sustainability, including element abundance, production rates, as well as geopolitical factors. The research will combine elements of first-principles simulations (density functional theory) together with chemical filters developed through statistical analysis (machine learning) of structure and property datasets. Geraldine Regnier - Numerical modelling of low-enthalpy geothermal reservoirs Department of Earth Science and Engineering Supervisors: Professor Matthew Jackson and Dr Pablo Salinas Geothermal energy production has been growing globally in the past decades, providing a low-carbon and equitable baseload energy source. Subsurface aquifers can provide geothermal energy and also be used to store thermal energy, by pumping hot water in to the aquifer and stored to provide heating in winter. This provides an opportunity to decarbonise heating, which is today mostly satisfied by fossil fuels. In order to de-risk, develop and manage geothermal and aquifer thermal energy storage projects, it is essential to use numerical models to predict fluid flow and heat transport in reservoirs. This project will apply the Imperial College Finite Element Simulator (IC-FERST), a next-generation adaptive-mesh simulator, to low-enthalpy geothermal sedimentary reservoirs. The first aim will be to demonstrate the numerical capabilities of the simulator, particularly the benefits of adaptive meshing. The project will then focus on applying the code to a range of case studies, investigating the effects of subsurface heterogeneity, how neighbouring installations interact and how energy production can be optimised. Felix Richter - SPORES-ON-A-CHIP: Investigations on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi using novel microfluidic technology Supervisors: Dr Claire Stanley and Professor Darryl Overby Funder: Department of Bioengineering Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form one of the most important classes of soil fungi, colonising roots of more than 80% of all plant species on Earth. They also contribute to carbon storage, the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as bioremediation. AMF also have the potential to reduce the need for fertilisers and pesticides, increasing the sustainability and environmental impacts of agriculture. This project aims to develop a novel microfluidic device to gain experimental access to spores of AMF at the cellular level in real time. The major goal is to investigate how physical obstacles induce a physiological response in AMF hyphae. Preliminary data revealed that pre-symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae branched extensively after colliding with physical obstacles. This stimulation of high-density hyphal branching suggests that AMF may be able to exploit such mechanisms for survival by increasing the chance of finding and/or penetrating a plant root and represents the first observation of its kind for AMF."
