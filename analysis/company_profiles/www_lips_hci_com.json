    "3DRuler is a 3D Metrology middleware that currently offers automatic measurement over L-W-H sizes of cuboid-shape or arbitrary shape object, like cardboard boxes, pallet...etc. People counting can differ dramatically in the way how people is to be counted as to from what angle the depth camera is mounted. It analyzes facial features including closing both eye lids and/or head's forward pitch angle greater than pre-defined degree for a pre-defined length of seconds, that signifies fatigue. This middleware captures detected hand's various gestures moving in a relatively natural motion. Full-body user tracking can uniquely segment and track multiple users as well as the motion of the detected body skeletons. Face recognition includes identity, gender, age, liveness, and face's pitch/ yaw/roll angles.",
    "Face recognition includes identity, gender, age, liveness, and face's pitch/ yaw/roll angles. To make sure your LIPS camera has the latest features, you will need to update it by downloading and installing the latest camera software. 1. Can extract 47 facial landmarks. 2. Can detect identity, gender, and age group (kids, young adult, adult, senior) Face properties include: liveness, face's pitch/yaw/roll angles, face ROI. Specifications are subject to change without notice. Operating ranges and accuracy can be scene dependent. 3DRuler is a 3D Metrology middleware that currently offers automatic measurement over L-W-H sizes of cuboid-shape or arbitrary shape object, like cardboard boxes, pallet...etc. People counting can differ dramatically in the way how people is to be counted as to from what angle the depth camera is mounted.

    "NiViewer is also part of the LIPS' OpenNI 1.5/2.2 compatible SDK. It's a tool that can display depth map and RGB view side by side for comparison purpose. At the bottom are real-time 3D coordinates (x, y, z or the depth) corresponding to the red dot on the screen that user can move to the point of interest with mouse. With the dot fixated on a moving object, such as hand, moving to and from the camera, you can clearly see even a minute movement can be captured and reflected on the change of the depth coordinate. This demo tracks the horizontal and vertical motions of your hand gesture by highlighting the square block corresponding to your hand's position in the grid on the screen. Additionally, it also senses the \"push†motion of your hand by showing the highlighted square block corresponding to your hand's position in a pushed state. Hand gestures tracking (slide hand to left/right/up/down/diagonal, push hand or grip to select, pinch fingers to shrink, spread fingers to enlarge, …etc) can be an intuitive alternative to most touch-based UI as a touchless modern-day natural UI. This demo shows how our motion tracking translates your gesture commands to Windows commands. For a few seconds you feel like you are possessed by Tom Cruise in the futuristic movie \"Minority Reportâ€. This is a realization of three-dimensional capturing of object at the sight of our depth camera. The 3D data can then be manipulated through transformation such as rotation and resizing for 3D modeling applications. Finally, let's showcase the fun of anthropomorphizing our MikuMikuDance cutie to dance just like you do. This is a perfect example of a third-party game on top of OpenNI that can be replaced with LIPS' OpenNI compatible SDK+depth camera suite and works immediately out of box. By standing in front of the camera momentarily, you'll soon be fantasized through our motion tracking into the character and just can't help dancing like crazy. This is an application of previous \"Track Pad†demo through which your hand gesture moving left/right and forward is tracked and used for positioning for and firing from alien's firepower in the game. This further demonstrates our support for multiple platforms including the popular Android device through gesture interface with its native game app.",

    "Who are we? Established since 2013 in the silicon valley of city of Taipei, LIPS was born with a promising vision that is \"Create a Real 3D World\" preordained by the founder's second sight. It may sound simple and straight however brainpower intensive. The good news to you and the world who have been waiting eagerly for its debut is: Yes, we did it! What makes LIPS stand out so well in the competition is a team of MIT scholars that founded the company and years of dedicated research on convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning spanning over institutions and industries in 3D machine vision and only this, period. This persistent investment and tenacious lab research along with final fruitful results effectively put the company and its products as a frontrunner in the 3D vision industry. What makes LIPS special? To further make life of our customers easier, we set out in the early stage to become a total 3D vision solution provider including lines of low-cost high-performance depth cameras and OpenNI 1.5/2.2 compatible middleware SDK which guarantees doing the work out of the box and free of compatibility concern. This strategy turns out to be a smart and first choice to and is appreciated by our customers. Depending upon applications, our customers may choose from 3D depth cameras based on different technologies behind the scene suiting your needs including ToF (Time of Flight), Stereo, Structured Light, and Array Camera. On top of these technologies, there's also an FPGA standalone solution offering customers the maximum flexibility in their product integration. These technologies in the cameras that we have to offer combined with our incomparable and patented algorithm performance in middleware SDK exploiting parallel processing to its extreme undoubtedly gives our throughput-hungry customers the needed edge in their own advanced product development. These strong and constant demands from our customers have been driving us to excel and transcend over the years manifested in our product generations. What are LIPS committed to? Rest assured that LIPS was created with decades of new inventions planned ahead. Once you stay with us, you will never be left alone. Our dream is to ultimately carve the \"LIPS Inside\" product slogan in this obsessively marvelous 3D machine vision industry. We believe we'll eventually be able to share this joy and glory with all of our customers that choose to join us today. To borrow the statements from one of our prominent technology partner, that is \"Realistic is not enough, it's gotta be Real\". At LIPS, we strive to deliver only the best-of-breed real 3D depth camera total solutions so the world can be truly captured photoreal through the eyes of our creations.
