    "Cloud-Based Solutions Cloud-based biometric technology is faster than the traditional biometric technology. You also get improved speeds because of the reduced system complexities. Hosting in the cloud such as Salesforce Github is also advantageous in that there is no need to schedule software updates and maintenance, meaning improved uptime. Many organizations that have yet to move their ABIS to the cloud fail to do so because of perceived cloud security and privacy issues. The fact is, however, that customers and cloud providers can now create a governance framework by leveraging existing ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 standards which, together, provide the requirements for creating the necessary controls to use and implement security best practices. T4ISB will help you choose the best biometrics and blockchain solution for your business and deploy it for you. < Back Cloud-Based Solutions Cloud-based biometric technology is faster than the traditional biometric technology.
