    "Are you need IT Support Engineer? Free Consultant Zero Trust with Zero Hassles How Biometrics Diminishes the Security Risk of a Remote Workforce When catastrophe strikes, it's human nature to look for silver linings. The pandemic has offered up its share, including for many, the freedom and flexibility to work from home. They've included people whose jobs would previously never be considered for remote work due to data privacy and security concerns. Employees who access financial records, medical records, credit cards, social security numbers, intellectual property – all are folks who have traditionally been expected to work onsite, no exceptions. It's difficult enough to manage security in a physically controlled workspace. It's even more complicated when employees are working remotely. Cyberthreats now outrank physical threats as the most significant security risk facing companies. Until recently, CSOs, CTOs, and CIOs assumed that damage to their network would come from the outside. Once network users were verified, authenticated, and logged in, they crossed a metaphorical drawbridge and were relatively free to move about within the castle. The company's cyber-guards had all their weapons pointing outward, overlooking the moat. Today, security management has become wiser. They've realized that threats are just as likely to come from inside a network. As a result, \"Zero Trust†policy is gaining traction as the preferred network architecture. Zero Trust is just what it sounds like – it's a paradigm that assumes nothing and nobody can be trusted just because they're inside the network. As a result, users must repeatedly verify and authenticate their identity with each step they take. The network perceives every action through a lens of suspicion: opening software, opening a file, editing a file, saving a file, and sending an email are just a few examples of activities that require verification and authentication. In theory, Zero Trust makes complete sense. A day doesn't go by when we don't hear about a prominent company, hospital, government agency, or – yes, a pipeline – becoming the victim of a cyberattack. More organizations implementing Zero Trust would undoubtedly reduce the occurrence of these harmful and expensive attacks. However, the most effective solutions aren't necessarily the most practical to implement. Just imagine what a hassle it would be for workers to enter a password repeatedly, all day long. Replacing passwords with biometric identity can take all of the inconvenience out of Zero Trust policies. By using a computer's embedded camera or attaching an encrypted biometric reader to verify the user's face or iris, networks can continually validate that only authenticated users are accessing the network. From the employee's perspective, the process is completely automated and seamless. They just go about their job sitting in front of their computer. However, if someone else were to take their place or join them, the computer would immediately shut down or close the application. The camera would identify that person is not authorized to access that information. Use of the iris biometric addresses employee privacy concerns; unlike a face, it cannot be visually linked to an individual. Only the enrollment database knows who the iris belongs to. The beauty of using biometrics in this way is that, when combined with other technologies like computer privacy screens, it removes any distinction between the security implications of working onsite versus remotely. The applications are wide-ranging. Legal documents, government documents, medical records, and all sorts of files that would normally never leave the office can be accessible to workers logging in from home. Security and alarm companies can allow authorized employees to monitor cameras remotely, outside the central monitoring station, without breaching privacy policies. Students can take tightly monitored exams, like board certifications, without traveling to a testing facility. Biometric enrollment occurs beforehand with the help of a mobile app. Many of the work changes we've experienced in the past year will have a long-lasting impact. The pandemic has proven the extent to which a remote or hybrid workforce can reduce operational costs. Hiring managers are finding better talent when geography no longer matters. Employees who have a choice of where they work, and the freedom to better balance the demands of work and their personal lives, are happier and more likely to stick around. Businesses that were once certain all workers would eventually return to the office are now reevaluating. For corporations, security is sacred especially when it comes to protecting confidential information. Historically, it has trumped concerns for employee convenience or flexibility. Thanks to biometrics, that balancing act will soon be a whole lot easier for many more companies. Even as they move to a Zero Trust model, their employees will enjoy greater freedoms and more seamless network interactions. Biometrics makes Zero Trust and zero hassles both possible.

Our staff and visitors love the user experience, and installation was one of the best I've experienced.†â€Adding biometrics to our access control and identity management systems has been one of the best decisions that we've made in implementing a comprehensive security program for our facilities. Princeton Identity has been a great partner to work with.\" FAQS How does PI offer the most FLEXIBLE identity assurance solutions available? Our solutions cover the widest range of capabilities in the market and are fully configurable to address your complete set of applications requirements. Our devices offer six (!) identification modalities in one small edge-mounted hardware package, and can operate indoors or out. You can configure your system's numerous authentication mode options by device, group, or user, and even chose among on-prem or cloud-based options for data storage and server operation. Even our sales model has various pathways to fit any organizational preferences. Why are PI edge devices the most ACCURATE in the market? Our solutions take advantage of the wonderous human iris - the most unique and stable biometric identifier - and are built on PI's foundational and proprietary Iris-on-the-Move(TM) technology. This combination drastically speeds up identity assurance while mitigating sources of error, and further enables precision results when leveraged as part of a multi-factor authentication. And yeah, our same readers do MFA, too! What makes PI's solutions more CONVENIENT than our competitors'? With nothing to carry, lose, or touch, our readers can quickly verify your identity even with glasses, goggles, hats, masks, headscarves, helmets, face paint, mouthguards, and other face-obstructing accessories - offering users fast and effortless authentication at a glance. PI solutions are also easy to install with bolt-on hardware, single-wire PoE+ connectivity, and dozens of turnkey API integrations. They are simple to set up and administer with seamless enrollment workflow options and our highly-learnable and usable web-based administrator portal. And for sure, your IT group will love that our single ecosystem can address requirements across the widest variety of applications. Why is identity assurance using the IRIS more SCALABLE than using face? The iris is THE MOST UNIQUE BIOMETRIC… PERIOD! It contains a tremendous density and quantity of information, its structure is genetics independent, and you have two that are completely different. That's why global databases UIDA India and WorldCoin rely on the iris to eliminate false match rates even as they enroll billions of users. The iris is also ultra-stable as you age and isn't changed with makeup, piercings, tattoos, etc. like your face, so identification is truly based on YOU, and NOT YOUR APPEARANCE.
