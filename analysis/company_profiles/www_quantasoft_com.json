    "Smart City The first step in the city becoming a \"smart city†is collecting more and better data. Thanks to A.I. and Computer Vision it's super easy to gather real time data of any targeted city area. Quantasoft Smart City Analytics Quantasoft Deep Learning Analytics provides cities with wide range of functionalities that enhance city surveillance to prevent crime, improve traffic & incident management and shorten emergency response times. Need? Intelligent Parking Our Video Analytics helps you detect free parking spaces and monitors the individual parking duration. Best deployed at parking lots, car parks, airports, railway stations or park-and-ride facilities. License Plate Reading (LPR) LPR Video Analytics automatically recognizes and saves license plates on vehicles and matches them with the database Traffic Analysis Video analytics uses artificial intelligence and deep learning to automatically detect and classify video events from unstructured video data. The resulting data help can help city authorities to optimise traffic within the city or fix any incidents faster. Are you interested in new technology which can grow your business?

    "Industry 4.0 With the rise of the Industry 4.0 \"smart factoryâ€, visual intelligence will expand into new applications, and quickly becomes critical aspect of various manufacturing processes. Quantasoft A.I. Video Inspections Quantasoft Video Inspection and Quality Check system is cost-effective and capable vision technology based on our innovative approach including Deep Learning methods like 3D Boxes as CNN, capability to provide inspections, product quality checks as well as audit of manufacturing and operating processes in various industry sectors. Need? Inspections Automated Visual Inspection for the final products or individual components prior to the assembly while detecting defective parts with the objective to generate new operational efficiencies and costs savings. Quality assurance Automated Quality assurance solution can detect tiny scratches, dents, hairline cracks, etc. which are not visible to the naked eye and are human resources intensive. Detected damages can thus be removed automatically and in a timely fashion, before they proceed further in the process chain. Optimising processes Quantasoft 3D Pose Estimation technology is a very effective way to run Cyber-physical transformation of manual process on the production lines with the ultimate result in the form of fully digitalised outputs for process optimisation.

    "Deep learning Biometrics Recognition Systems O Our unique person identification technique is built on our objects based recognition and face recognition algorithms to detect and identify accurately presence of target individuals or objects in multi-camera environment. Person & Objects Identification We build a complete security systems of Biometric Artificial Intelligence that can identify uniquely persons, objects, fingerprints or eye iris. System is fully capable of tracking multiple objects, Person Re-Identification on Multi-Camera systems based on similarity and appearance algorithms. Quantasoft system uses combination of Deep Learning, HW accelerated, image processing and image recognition methods. Need? Person Identification Face Detection Verification 1:1 Identification 1:N Emotion, Gender, Age Tracking, Re-Identification Multi-Camera, Multi-Object tracking Video Frame Annotation (VFA) Scene labeling/tagging Object features for people People Class/Gender – male, female Age range Pose estimation Upper/Lower Wear color Event & Alarms The module provides highly accurate real-time event detections and alarms. These events eliminate the need to rely on the alertness or response discipline of the system's operator. Users define potential events of interest in advance and receive alerts when such events occur, enabling rapid responses to incidents, as they emerge.
