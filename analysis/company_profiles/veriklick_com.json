    "Step Up Your Recruiting Strategy In 2019 July 31, 2021 By: Komal Dangi The landscape of human resources has changed dramatically over the course of 2018. As tools using artificial intelligence increase company accessibility and mobility, it is imperative for recruiters to adapt and rethink their recruitment strategies. If HR managers focus on incorporating three key elements in their recruitment strategies, their companies will undoubtedly attract the top talent in 2019. 1. Faster candidate screening Candidates are being swept up at a record pace. Top candidates are quickly hired, as quick as in 10 days, says Inc.com . In order to land top candidates, it is crucial for HR managers to find ways to speed up the hiring process. Candidate screenings are among the most time-consuming elements of the hiring process. However, traditional screenings are no longer effective. By the time recruiters are done manually vetting a resume, their ideal candidates have already been scooped up. The process of screening candidates is unnecessarily long, and can be significantly shortened using available technology. Intelligent screening software, for example, uses machine learning to automate resume screenings. The software learns what skills and past experience are ideal for an employer based on the success of past hires. The software automatically compiles this information to vet and fast-track the strongest candidates. Speeding up candidate screenings will result in faster, quality hires in 2019. Just be careful that your ATS isn't learning to be biased , because of who you've hired in the past. 2. Improved candidate engagement 65% of candidates claim to never receive application updates from a recruiter. Consistent candidate engagement plays a pivotal role in a company attracting top applicants. In fact, candidates who are not informed of their application status are 3 ½ times less likely to re-apply to that company. For recruiters looking to improve candidate engagement in the coming year, applicant tracking systems make it easier than ever. These systems can communicate with candidates consistently through each stage of the recruitment process, updating them on their status in real-time. Not only does this save the recruiter hours of email and call updates, but it also improves the candidate experience. AI-powered chatbots streamline communication, as well. Fully equipped with natural language processing, chatbots can answer any question a candidate may have regardless of the time or place. Candidates are able to access critical information, and no longer have to wait several days for a response, if they receive one at all. Chatbots also gather employee and candidate information to make insightful business decisions. Improving candidate engagement should be atop every recruiter's recruitment strategy in 2019. 3. Eliminate biases 57% of recruiters believe implicit biases play a role in the American workforce. Hiring managers subconsciously prefer candidates with whom they have most in common. Candidates are not winning jobs based on merit. With AI, however, human biases are eliminated. AI uses an algorithm assessment platform, free of biased language, opening the door to qualified, diverse candidates and drawing a larger talent pool to hire from. An analysis of studies over many years confirms that minority applicants receive fewer callbacks than white applicants, up to 50% fewer. AI helps level the playing field, ensuring diverse applicants are not screened out due to bias. The process of blind screening prevents any applicant from slipping through the cracks, assessing candidates based on merit alone. Eliminating biases will be crucial for recruiters in 2019, in order to land the very best talent possible. Projecting into 2019 Innovation and technology is paving the way to faster, more efficient hiring, and cutting costs along the way. The hiring process is moving faster than ever, and recruiters would be wise to keep pace. For recruiters looking to attract the top talent in 2019, it is imperative to adopt new strategies or risk losing talent to competitors.
