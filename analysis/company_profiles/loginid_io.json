    "LoginID will research and prototype changes to their APIs and SDKs making it simple for Algorand developers to integrate FIDO-certified biometric authentication. San Mateo/Hong Kong, October 7, 2021 - The Algorand Foundation announced today, support for a grant awarded to LoginID , a FIDO-certified authentication provider. The grant will allow LoginID to research building a technical path towards enabling its suite of APIs and SDKS for the Algorand ecosystem. For Algorand developers and enterprises this means utilizing FIDO-certified authentication for a one touch execution of a smart contract, which will not require plugins or downloads to complete. Integration of FIDO also provides the benefit of 'Transaction Confirmation', a digital signature and receipt binding the individual's biometric to the transaction. At the heart of the Algorand blockchain is a unique and powerful protocol known as Pure Proof-of-Stake, created by MIT's Silvio Micali. Using this protocol, the Algorand blockchain is a unique combination of high performance, scale, security, guaranteed transaction finality and all built on a carbon negative, sustainable platform. The Algorand network has now grown to over 13 million accounts and is supporting over 1 million transactions a day, with zero downtime since launch. The Algorand Foundation is committed to building the most robust and innovative ecosystem around this amazing, public blockchain and bringing one-touch smart contract execution will be a powerful addition to the toolkit of Algorand developers. The Algorand Foundation is delighted to welcome LoginID to the ecosystem of the Algorand network. Providing FIDO certified, one touch smart contract execution to Algorand developers and enterprises will enable any customer to execute a smart contract by using the biometrics on their device, without any downloads or plugins needed. Given there are over 4B devices globally that support FIDO today, this is a significant step in making Algorand available to all.† said Sean Lee, CEO Algorand Foundation. \"Algorand has really started to accelerate, helping businesses in the DeFi and commerce space, areas where we have expertise and can add a lot of value. LoginID will help lower friction, and make blockchain technology easier to interact when developers integrate our solution. We have recently seen attacks on standard forms of authentication such as SMS. Our solution will help give Algorand developers the tools to create the most frictionless, secure interactions for their customers†says Jim Brown, CRO and Co-founder of LoginID. See the video interview for this announcement. About Algorand Foundation The Algorand Foundation is dedicated to fulfilling the global promise of blockchain technology by leveraging the Algorand protocol and open source software, which was initially designed by Silvio Micali and a team of leading scientists. With core beliefs in the establishment of an open, public and permissionless blockchain, the Algorand Foundation has a vision for an inclusive ecosystem that provides an opportunity for everyone to harness the potential of an equitable and truly borderless economy.

    "The LoginID FIDO2 and UAF certified Strong Customer Authentication platform will provide Data on Tap, Execuvault, NetCents, Global Asset Technology, POS Connect, and FroogalPay customers frictionless, secure biometric logins, removing the need for traditional logins and passwords San Mateo, CA, July 9, 2020. - LoginID Inc. has announced new partnerships as part of its launch of FIDO-as-a-Service, for small and medium sized enterprises. This follows on its recent announcement for the Indonesian market, with eKYC leader, ASLI RI. The new partners announced will integrate the LoginID FIDO2 and UAF certified biometric strong customer authentication in support of various use-cases. By integrating the LoginID strong customer authentication, partners will now be able to reduce end-user dependency on weak logins and passwords. According to the FIDO Alliance, 64% of eCommerce customers and 78% of peer to peer transfer users, prefer stronger authentication versus traditional logins and passwords. With LoginID's FIDO-as-a-Service, partners will be able to provide their customers additional confidence, and higher security in their daily digital interactions, eliminating passwords and logins. \"Developers and enterprises are looking for very low-lift integrations of leading-edge products. Our FIDO2 and UAF certified strong customer authentication can be integrated in less than an hour, and will provide end-users a frictionless experience†says Simon Law, CEO of LoginID. Differing from proprietary biometric solutions, the LoginID FIDO2 and UAF certified platform utilizes cryptographic security based on the customer's device hardware, therefore it is not vulnerable to hacks or OS takeovers. It works right out of the box, with no additional hardware or downloadable software required by customers. The customer experience is very simple and intuitive, with a 'biometric login' button displayed, where customers can use their fingerprint scanner on their device to login to an application or website. Customers won't have to remember passwords or use other weaker forms of logging in. Data on Tap is a Canadian based telecom technology company that is developing a digital ecosystem of highly-customized mobile services serving smartphone customers. \"With the LoginID FIDO2 service we will be able to increase digital in-app and web interactions security and where required provide additional authentication and user level control,†says Algis Akstinas, CEO of Data on Tap. \"This will also alleviate any customer concerns around SIM swap attacks, which is becoming more of a prevalent issue for customersâ€.

    "Data protection safeguards: the GDPR requires firms to put in place safeguards to protect personal information. Strong, multi-factor authentication is crucial to that end, because it reduces the risk of weak or stolen passwords, which are a key vulnerability that drive the vast majority of breaches. However, many forms of MFA are still exposed to phishing and malware. By contrast, we use public key cryptography, which enables cutting-edge 'high assurance authentication' - this means our MFA has the strongest safeguards. User rights management: the law gives individuals the right to change, delete, view, and move their data, and, in many cases, requires firms to demonstrate that they have obtained users' explicit consent to collect their data. This can only be done securely if the identity of the requestor has been authenticated effectively. Our authentication solutions provide the most accurate, effective means of achieving that. Privacy-by-design: a key requirement of the GDPR is that companies design new products with privacy in mind. In addition, certain information, such as biometrics, is considered particularly sensitive. We have adopted a privacy-by-design approach, as is reflected in the fact that the user's biometrics never leave their device. Strong Customer Authentication: the PSD2 requires that users be authenticated using a mix of at least two elements that relate to possession (something you own), inherence (something you are) and/or knowledge ('something you know'). Our authentication solution is inherently a 2-factor authentication method that is explicitly PSD2 compliant. Security: to comply with the PSD2, companies must mitigate the risk that any of the elements used for authentication are accessed by unauthorized parties. Our solutions ensure that the elements stary in the authenticating device – even if the device is stolen, that information cannot be read, copied or transferred, and the user cannot authenticate unless they have the necessary inherent features (e.g. biometrics) or knowledge. Transaction Confirmation: the PSD2 mandates that payment services must have a secure mechanism that allows users to review and confirm the transaction. We support this through a mechanism by which the details of the transaction and a confirmation request are sent to the user, who in turn authorizes payment – e.g. by scanning a fingerprint.
