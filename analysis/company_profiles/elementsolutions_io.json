    "A digital platform designed for seamless connection of electric vehicle charging stations. The goal is to make EV charging as accessible, convenient, and efficient as possible for users. What does the platform provide? The platform unites charging stations from different operators in one place, allowing you to easily find and access any available charging point, regardless of its owner or location. Why is this important? We understand the importance of accessible charging stations for electric vehicle owners. Therefore, the process of expanding the network is actively underway so that customers can charge their cars without unnecessary effort and long searches. What now? Not only has a convenient platform been created for connecting charging stations, but the user experience has also been improved by integrating a mobile application. The mobile application allows users to manage the charging process, make payments, and easily integrate with other services.
