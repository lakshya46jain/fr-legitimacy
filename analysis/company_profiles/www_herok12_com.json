Your Educational Agency uses Hero services to assist with the administration of school-related activities and to provide a streamlined way to collect, organize, access, and report your information for educational purposes. These uses are specific to each Educational Agency and are governed by the contract between Hero and your Educational Agency.

We keep personal information until it is deleted, or until we no longer need it to provide school with the Service. We will not retain student personal information for any longer than is necessary for educational purposes and legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the student personal information. In the event of termination of a license to use our products, Hero will destroy all student records contained in our systems within 180 days on a written request from the schools to Privacy Director, unless we are required by law or the student's school to retain it, or need it to protect the safety of our users. Note that some content may be kept after an account is deleted for school legal compliance reasons (e.g. maintenance of \"education records\" under FERPA or \"student records\" under various state student privacy laws).
