    "ABOUT THE WHOO DOOR INTERCOM SYSTEM Whoo is all about access and privacy. We are bringing the convenience of keyless entry and smartphone control to your multi-tenant building. Our multi-tenant door intercom system and smartphone app are easy to use, consistent, and intuitive. And we are always striving to make our products better. We listen to our users because you know best. FAQ Q Why would I want the Whoo Intercom System? To know at all times who is at the front of your building whether you are at home or away, you will now always have control over the access to your building so no more missed or stolen packages, lost keys or leaving a visitor out in the cold if your running late. Q What does my building need to get started? Whoo uses Power over Ethernet and an electric door strike to power the intercom. You need internet access for our door intercom system. Q What if my building doesn't have internet access? You will need a basic internet connection that has upload speeds of at lease 2 Mbps (megabits per second). Comcast's Performance Starter package offers internet for as low as $25 a month. Q How long will an installation take? Installation is easy and the device is up and running in less than a day. Q Will I need an electrician? No. The Whoo doorphone is very easy to install. A handyman or super can do it. But we do recommend that you contact one of our certified installers. Q What if my building has more than one entrance? If you use multiple entrances for your building, we can install a Whoo intercom at each entrance. If your building only has one entrance, but there are two doors (i.e. a main door leading into a vestibule/foyer and then a door into the lobby), the Whoo intercom can be configured to control both doors. Q Where can I purchase Whoo for my building? Whoo is available for installation anywhere in the U.S. For installation information or a customized quote, . Q What device does Whoo run on? Users can use any smart device that runs on either iOS or Android. Q Can I get a code for delivery people? Yes! Your app lets you generate a temporary code that you include with your delivery orders... the driver won;t ring your apartment - instead, they will press the \"deliveries button and be prompted to enter the temporary code, which will open the appropriate door(s) for them. Q What about the mailman? The building Manager can also give a permanent code to your local post office that opens the appropriate door like any other deliveries. Q What about my privacy? Whoo takes your privacy very seriously. You always maintain control over all your information. Read our here . Q What if my building already has a buzzer? Now you can upgrade seamlessly to a modern smartphone app that will allow you to see exactly who is there. During installation, we will remove your existing intercom panel and simply replace it with our device. Q Can I use Whoo on gated entry? Yes. Whoo is not just for buildings. It is good for any location where multiple people can open a common door or gate. Q Does every tenant need to have a smart phone? No. Whoo can also call any telephone number and work as an audio-only telephone entry system. Q How does the subscription fee work if my building has unoccupied units? If an apartment is not occupied we don't add a call button for that unit, nor charge the subscription fee. Once the unit becomes occupied, we can add a button and update your subscription. Q What happens if my Whoo Intercom needs technical support? We provide technical support remotely and, if necessary, our local installers can replace the unit. All of this is covered under our 1 year warranty. Have Additional Questions? Ask Us Here SUPPORT Need help with your Whoo intercom or have questions about our products?

On the day of installation, you will receive an invitation to access our Whoo Console — the platform you'll use to add residents and invite them to connect with the new intercom system being installed at your building(s). What You'll Need to Get Started: Tenant Details Including resident names, apartment numbers, and contact information (email and/or phone number) to properly configure the intercom and send app invitations. Credit Card Information For activating your subscription. Payments are processed automatically through our secure system. Create Your User Account You'll receive an email invitation that looks like the example below: crate-accunt How to Activate Your Account Click the blue \"Activate My Account\" button. This will open a new window in your web browser. Press \"Continue\" and follow the prompts to create a password. This step completes the account creation process. Important: Once your account is created, make sure to save your login information. This is how you'll access your building, so keeping this information secure is essential. set-up-resident Set up Residents for your Building(s) Invite residents to use intercom and Whoo App. Getting Started in the Whoo Console When you first to the Console, you may see an empty homepage with no Properties listed. This simply means your account setup is still in progress. Your Sales Representative is working on adding your Properties and Buildings, and will notify you once everything is ready. Setting Up Your Building Once your Property(ies) and Building(s) have been added, you'll need to complete the Resident Setup for each building. Follow these steps: Click on the name of the Property that shows a status labeled \"Setup Residents.\" Then, click \"Setup Residents\" on the associated building card. This will take you to the Building Setup screen, which consists of 2 simple steps to complete your configuration. ​ Step 1 of 2 – Upload Resident Info a. Download the Template Click to download the Excel template provided in the Console. b. Fill Out the \"My Building\" Tab Open the file and go to the \"My Building\" tab. You'll see helpful tooltips and column headers starting in Row 3. Follow these instructions carefully: ColumnDescription: ​ Unit# - This is the most important field. Each unit number creates a button on the intercom.-The intercom system displays this information Label. (e.g., \"LAST NAME\", \"Front Desk\") -The intercom system displays this information Resident Name Used for your internal reference only and is searchable. Please put First Name, Last Name Email- Required if you want the tenant to receive a pairing email to download and connect the app. Phone #- ( Optional )unless the tenant is not using the app. If no app is paired, the system will use this number to call the tenant. You can refer to the \"Examples\" tab in the spreadsheet to see how the formatting should look, but only enter your data in the \"My Building\" tab. Understanding Intercom Behavior The Whoo intercom is designed primarily for residents to use the Whoo mobile app. The way the intercom behaves depends on whether or not the resident has paired their app: ✅ Scenario 1 – App Paired When a tenant downloads the app and completes pairing, their status in the Console changes from \"Not Paired\" to a green checkmark. Once paired, the intercom ignores the phone number and calls the app directly. Benefit: The tenant can answer from anywhere, see who is at the door with one-way video, and speak using two-way audio. 📞 Scenario 2 – App Not Paired If the tenant has not downloaded the app (status shows \"Not Paired\"), the intercom will call the phone number listed in the system. This ensures the tenant still receives calls even without the app, but it will be audio-only. Multiple Users per Unit and Pairing Devices You can add multiple users (roommates, family members, staff) to the same unit/button. If all have the app installed and paired, the first person to answer will get the video feed and speak to the visitor. Pairing Tablets or Additional Devices If you want to pair a tablet, additional phones, or any additional device You must create a separate entry in the spreadsheet for each device, even if it belongs to the same unit. This is because the system provides only one pairing code per device Each device needs its own pairing code to be linked to the intercom. 🔠Important: Pairing codes are unique per user. If you want to pair more than one device, each one must be added as a separate contact in the sheet. c. Upload the Completed File Once your information is filled out under the \"My Building\" tab, go back to the Console and upload the file. d. Click \"NEXT\" to proceed to Step 2. ​ Step 2 of 2 – Subscription Confirmation & Payment Method This screen will display the number of subscriptions being added to your account. You have two options: Click \"Pay Now\" if you're ready to enter your payment details. Click \"Send Invoice\" if someone else (e.g., your Accounts Payable team) will handle the payment. You will then be redirected to our secure payment provider, Stripe, where you can: Enter your credit card information Click \"Subscribe\" to complete the transaction Your card will be charged annually based on the number of active subscriptions. ✅ Onboarding Complete Once payment is submitted, you'll receive a confirmation message letting you know that your onboarding is complete and your system is ready to use. invite-residents Inviting Your Tenants Once your tenant list has been uploaded, you'll see all the residents displayed in the Console. To invite them to connect with the intercom: For each tenant, click the \"Not Paired\" button next to their name. This will generate an auto-filled email containing a unique pairing code. Send the email to each tenant individually so they can download the app and complete the setup. Sending Pairing Codes pairing-code Two Ways to Send a Pairing Code to Your Tenants You can send the pairing code using either of the following methods: 1. Click the \"Not Paired\" bubble This will automatically open your email client and generate a pre-filled email containing everything the tenant needs to pair their phone with the intercom system. 2. Click the Person Icon in the Action Column Then select \"Send Pairing Code.\" Just like above, this will open your email with a pre-filled message ready to send to the tenant. Both methods provide the tenant with the unique pairing code and clear instructions for getting started. ​ adding-tenants Adding Tenants to existing Residence Adding an Additional Tenant or Device to a Unit To add another resident or a device (like an iPad or tablet) to an existing unit: Locate the unit you'd like to update and click the house icon.

How Property Managers Can Share Pin Codes with Couriers To ensure secure and efficient deliveries, property managers should follow these steps when sharing building pin codes with couriers:​ ​ 1. Set Up Keyless Access Buttons in the Whoo Console - to the Whoo Console: Access your property's account in the Whoo console. - Create Keyless Buttons: Add a button for each courier (FedEx, UPS, USPS,) in the system. - Free of Charge: These buttons are complimentary and designed to simplify access for couriers. - Label Each Button Clearly: Assign clear, courier-specific names such as *FedEx Access*, *UPS Delivery*, *USPS Entry*, or *Management*. 2. Contact Courier Offices - Locate Contact Information: Identify the regional or local office contact details for each courier. - Courier-Specific Preferences: - FedEx & UPS: Use email to submit building codes and access instructions. - USPS: Visit or call your local post office, as they may require a physical form or additional confirmation. 3. Share Key Information When communicating with couriers, provide the following details: - Building Address: Include full details for clarity. - Assigned Pin Codes: Specify codes for entry through the intercom system. - Delivery Instructions: Highlight access hours, designated drop-off locations, or any other special instructions. 4. Explain Keyless Buttons Inform couriers that the keyless buttons are secure and user-friendly, providing hassle-free entry for authorized drivers. Highlight that this system simplifies the delivery process. Simply add the pin code under the \"DELIVERIES\" section in the intercom system. 5. Confirm Receipt - Request confirmation from the courier office to ensure the codes have been received and properly distributed to their drivers. - For Amazon, verify receipt through their platform or delivery support team. 6. Maintain Ongoing Communication - Update Promptly: Inform couriers immediately about any changes to pin codes or delivery instructions. - Encourage Feedback: Let couriers know they can contact the property manager if they encounter issues accessing the building. ​ By following these steps and leveraging the Whoo console, property managers can enhance building security while ensuring efficient and seamless delivery experiences for couriers.

This simply means your account setup is still in progress. Your Sales Representative is working on adding your Properties and Buildings, and will notify you once everything is ready. Setting Up Your Building Once your Property(ies) and Building(s) have been added, you'll need to complete the Resident Setup for each building. Follow these steps: Click on the name of the Property that shows a status labeled \"Setup Residents.\" Then, click \"Setup Residents\" on the associated building card. This will take you to the Building Setup screen, which consists of 2 simple steps to complete your configuration. ​ Step 1 of 2 – Upload Resident Info a. Download the Template Click to download the Excel template provided in the Console. b. Fill Out the \"My Building\" Tab Open the file and go to the \"My Building\" tab. You'll see helpful tooltips and column headers starting in Row 3. Follow these instructions carefully: ColumnDescription: ​ Unit# - This is the most important field. Each unit number creates a button on the intercom.-The intercom system displays this information Label. (e.g., \"LAST NAME\", \"Front Desk\") -The intercom system displays this information Resident Name Used for your internal reference only and is searchable. Please put First Name, Last Name Email- Required if you want the tenant to receive a pairing email to download and connect the app. Phone #- ( Optional )unless the tenant is not using the app. If no app is paired, the system will use this number to call the tenant. You can refer to the \"Examples\" tab in the spreadsheet to see how the formatting should look, but only enter your data in the \"My Building\" tab. Understanding Intercom Behavior The Whoo intercom is designed primarily for residents to use the Whoo mobile app. The way the intercom behaves depends on whether or not the resident has paired their app: ✅ Scenario 1 – App Paired When a tenant downloads the app and completes pairing, their status in the Console changes from \"Not Paired\" to a green checkmark. Once paired, the intercom ignores the phone number and calls the app directly. Benefit: The tenant can answer from anywhere, see who is at the door with one-way video, and speak using two-way audio. 📞 Scenario 2 – App Not Paired If the tenant has not downloaded the app (status shows \"Not Paired\"), the intercom will call the phone number listed in the system. This ensures the tenant still receives calls even without the app, but it will be audio-only. Multiple Users per Unit and Pairing Devices You can add multiple users (roommates, family members, staff) to the same unit/button. If all have the app installed and paired, the first person to answer will get the video feed and speak to the visitor. Pairing Tablets or Additional Devices If you want to pair a tablet, additional phones, or any additional device You must create a separate entry in the spreadsheet for each device, even if it belongs to the same unit. This is because the system provides only one pairing code per device Each device needs its own pairing code to be linked to the intercom. 🔠Important: Pairing codes are unique per user. If you want to pair more than one device, each one must be added as a separate contact in the sheet. c. Upload the Completed File Once your information is filled out under the \"My Building\" tab, go back to the Console and upload the file. d. Click \"NEXT\" to proceed to Step 2. ​ Step 2 of 2 – Subscription Confirmation & Payment Method This screen will display the number of subscriptions being added to your account. You have two options: Click \"Pay Now\" if you're ready to enter your payment details. Click \"Send Invoice\" if someone else (e.g., your Accounts Payable team) will handle the payment. You will then be redirected to our secure payment provider, Stripe, where you can: Enter your credit card information Click \"Subscribe\" to complete the transaction Your card will be charged annually based on the number of active subscriptions. ✅ Onboarding Complete Once payment is submitted, you'll receive a confirmation message letting you know that your onboarding is complete and your system is ready to use. invite-residents Inviting Your Tenants Once your tenant list has been uploaded, you'll see all the residents displayed in the Console.
