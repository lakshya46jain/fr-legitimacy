It reflects our commitment to prioritising the protection and privacy of personal data from the outset of our technology's design and implementation. Data Protection Approach FaiceTech have gained a considerable amount of experience and practical knowledge related to facial recognition data protection compliance in many different scenarios in many different territories around the world. We are well versed in providing the benefits of this specialist knowledge to clients to assist them with their own data protection compliance responsibilities.​ This specialist knowledge of data protection compliance with regards to processing biometric data for facial recognition processes has led FaiceTech to develop a set of red lines and areas of critical guidance for clients, which can be applied in consultation with new clients to assist their fast development of their own compliant processes and policies.

DEFINING COMPLIANCE Applying new technology to existing environments and behaviours can yield huge productivity gains, however if the ethics or protections of individual data rights are not considered diligently then these productivity gains can come at a cost – to both the individuals and the organisation.​ When processing biometric data adhering to data protection legislation is non-negotiable, but this can prove difficult to determine at the outset. However, there is a growing library of guidance from the ICO in the UK with regards to the compliant processing of biometric data that organisations can refer to.​ APPLYING THE 7 CORE PRINCIPLES OF UK GDPR UK GDPR outlines 7 core principles that are set out right at the start of the legislation and inform everything that follows. Compliance with the spirit of these key principles is therefore a fundamental building block for good data protection practice. It is also key to your compliance with the detailed provisions of the UK GDPR.​ With the deployment of facial recognition technologies, most of these principles refer to how an organisation choses to interact with its data subjects, with the principles of transparency, accuracy, integrity, accountability and purpose limitation being at the forefront of planning processes and creating key internal policies.​ However, compliance with some of these core principles requires the solution that an organisation adopts to be designed to with privacy in mind, such as data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation and confidentiality. ASSISTING CLIENTS WITH DATA PROTECTION FaiceTech have adopted a Privacy by Design approach to the development of all our solutions, ensuring that the features required to enable a client organisation to operate compliantly are built in and configurable.​ FaiceTech have also gained a considerable amount of experience and practical knowledge related to facial recognition data protection compliance in many different scenarios in many different territories around the world.

DATA PROTECTION | GDPR | PRIVACY There's no denying that the use of computer algorithms to process CCTV camera feeds is a sensitive subject. At FaiceTech we understand these concerns and attempt to address your questions below. Artificial Intelligence We only deploy independently tested and approved algorithms that are pre-trained by AI – no further training or learning occurs after deployment. AI DECISION MAKING Our systems do not make automated decisions about individuals, but they do make highly accurate comparisons between facial templates which will always be presented to a human for final verification before a client decides what action to take. DATA SEPARATION We provide separated instances of our technology for each of our clients and do not aggregate third party data from other sources, allowing clients to have full control over the data processing we carry out on their behalf, and giving them the peace of mind of knowing that the only data we process for them is subject to their strict processes alone. Racial Bias Our algorithms undergo rigorous testing to minimise all types of bias, after being trained with bias-free datasets, ensuring accuracy and fairness by using diverse datasets and continuous performance evaluation. The DPIA Before any service goes live, we assist each client in completing an extensive Data Protection Impact Assessment. IMPORTANCE OF SECURITY Cybersecurity is crucial when deploying facial recognition technology and processing special category data due to the sensitive nature of biometric information. FaiceTech have put in place s strong cybersecurity framework, which is essential to safeguarding against data breaches, unauthorised access, and identity theft, ensuring protection for individuals' privacy and organisational​ compliance. IMPORTANCE OF USING A HIGH RESOLUTION CAMERA High-resolution cameras are essential for facial recognition, capturing fine details that enhance identification accuracy, even in challenging conditions. They also enable building robust watchlists by capturing and storing high-quality images directly from the camera feed, reducing errors and enhancing security in critical applications.
