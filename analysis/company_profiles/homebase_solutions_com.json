    "The Evolution of Endpoint Security The endpoint security space has evolved over the last several years away from limited antivirus software and into a more advanced, comprehensive defence. This includes next-generation antivirus, threat detection, investigation, and response, device management, data leak protection (DLP), and other considerations to face evolving threats. Organisations of all sizes are at risk from nation-states, hacktivists, organised crime, and malicious and accidental insider threats. Endpoint security is often seen as cybersecurity's frontline, and represents one of the first places organisations look to secure their enterprise networks.As the volume and sophistication of cybersecurity threats have steadily grown, so has the need for more advanced endpoint security solutions. Today's endpoint protection systems are designed to quickly detect, analyse, block, and contain attacks in progress. To do this, they need to collaborate with each other and with other security technologies to give administrators visibility into advanced threats to speed detection and remediation response times. What's considered an endpoint? An endpoint is any device that connects to the corporate network from outside its firewall. Examples of endpoint devices include: Internet of things (IoT) devices Other devices that communicate with the central network Why is Endpoint Security Important? Increasingly, enterprises and their employees are incorporating practices to make access to data more fluid. The increase in BYOD (bring your own device) policies, in addition to threats targeting mobile device access and networks, create multiple endpoint vulnerabilities. In addition, employees working from home or connecting to Wi-Fi networks to work on-the-go means that the enterprise network security perimeter is more porous than ever.In the past, most security breaches came in through the network. Today, however, threats are increasingly coming in through endpoints, which means centralised network protection does not go far enough. Shifting security perimeters that lack clear definition require new layers of security through endpoint protection. Security must maintain greater control over access points to prevent the vulnerabilities that can arise through the use of remote devices. An endpoint protection platform (EPP) is a solution deployed on endpoint devices to prevent file-based malware attacks, detect malicious activity, and provide the investigation and remediation capabilities needed to respond to dynamic security incidents and alerts. Several vendors produce systems converging EPP systems with endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms – systems focused on threat detection, response, and unified monitoring. Endpoint security software protects endpoints from being breached – no matter if they are physical or virtual, on- or off-premise, in data centres or in the Cloud. It is installed on laptops, desktops, servers, virtual machines, as well as remote endpoints themselves. Fundamental Elements of An Endpoint Security Solution Next-generation antivirus (NGAV) uses advanced endpoint protection technologies, such as AI and machine learning, to identify new malware by examining more elements, such as file hashes, URLs, and IP addresses. An Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution needs to provide continuous and comprehensive visibility into what is happening on endpoints in real time. 3. Managed Threat Hunting Managed threat hunting is conducted by elite teams that learn from incidents that have already occurred, aggregate crowdsourced data, and provide guidance on how best to respond when malicious activity is detected. 4. Threat Intelligence Integration A threat intelligence integration solution should incorporate automation to investigate all incidents and gain knowledge in minutes, not hours. It should generate custom indicators of compromise (IoCs) directly from the endpoints to enable a proactive defence against future attacks. Endpoint Security vs. Network Security Antivirus programs are designed to safeguard a single endpoint, offering visibility into only that endpoint, in many cases only from that endpoint. Endpoint security software, however, looks at the enterprise network as a whole and can offer visibility of all connected endpoints from a single location. homebase solutions & Endpoint Security Homebase offers an AI-enabled biometric authentication SaaS software based on face recognition to control access and anonymously identify remote employees at a customizable regular interval which offers continuous authentication. Our software ensures that the right employee is accessing the right endpoint when dealing with a company's sensitive data.The processes are GDPR compliant with strict privacy policies in place to protect your remote employees' privacy.

    "Tapping into biometrical authentication with facial recognition for remote work With businesses offering employees the flexibility of remote work comes the challenge of protecting physical access to the company's data. Here to meet that challenge is biometric authentication with facial recognition. What is Zero Trust Zero Trust is an innovative cybersecurity concept. Its motto dictates to \"always verify and never trust\". But what does that mean? What is Endpoint Security? Endpoint security refers to securing endpoints, or end-user devices like desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. Endpoints serve as points of access to an enterprise network and create points of entry that can be exploited by malicious actors. Remote Work Security Best Practices Employees have reported surprising benefits from working remotely besides newly flexible work schedules, several perks make the extra security precautions worthwhile. The Most Common Types of Biometric Authentication: Pros & Cons Biometrics is the analysis of unique biological and physiological characteristics with the aim of confirming a person's identity. The four most common types of biometric identifiers are: fingerprints, voice, eye, and facial recognition.

    "Biometrics is the analysis of unique biological and physiological characteristics with the aim of confirming a person's identity. The four most common types of biometric identifiers are: fingerprints, voice, eye, and facial recognition. Everyone's fingerprints are unique to them. So, by analysing the ridges and pattern of the print, fingerprint scanners create a digital model which is compared against future attempts to authenticate. Fingerprints are typically used to authenticate someone, rather than identify someone - which is what Disney parks do to allow admittance to different areas of the park. Similarly, some organisations use fingerprint scanners instead of timecards.These systems use a digital camera and light. Once a user places their finger on the flat surface, the software aligns the print against several pegs to ensure a correct reading. There are over 30 specific points (called minutiae) in a fingerprint that a scanner will obtain for identification. Fingerprints are unique identifiers specific to the individual. Fingerprint scanners are relatively cheap and can even be bought on Amazon. Used in many industries Among the most ubiquitous modalities Injuries, temporary or permanent, can interfere with scans. It is a technology that can be bypassed with methods that copy and replicate fingerprints. It's hard to copy one's fingerprint, but it's not impossible. It can be bypassed by using someone else's finger while they are asleep or unconscious. Voice recognition, otherwise known as voiceprints, is unique in the sense that your vocal cavities create a specific shape when your mouth moves to speak. For this to work, you would need to say an exact word or phrase that the system requires, or give an extended sample of your speech so that it can recognize you no matter what you're saying.The data used in a voiceprint is called a sound spectrogram, which is essentially a graph that shows sound frequency. Different speech sounds will create different shapes on the graph. These graphs also use colours or shades of grey to represent the qualities of the sound of a voice. Offers a convenient authentication experience Some software provides a phrase for the user Users may not understand how their data is stored and have privacy-related concerns. Noisy places may prevent successful authentication. Severe respiratory illness may decrease the success rate of authentication. Contrary to popular belief, there are actually two methods of scanning the eye for the purposes of authentication. The scan leverages iris recognition or retina recognition to identify users.In a retinal scan, the authenticator shines a light briefly into the eye to illuminate the unique pattern of blood vessels in the eye. By mapping this pattern, the eye recognition tool can compare a user's eyes against an original. Iris scans work similarly, but they analyse the colored rings found in the iris. In some implementations, eye recognition can be as fast and accurate as face recognition (though less user-friendly). Iris is an internal organ that is well protected against damage by a highly transparent and sensitive membrane. Thus, it's unlikely for minor injuries to influence scanning devices. This technology is relatively new and still requires improvements. It is a method that requires a short distance between the device and the user's eye. In low light conditions, the chances of iris recognition are really poor. Facial recognition is when software is used that maps an individual's facial features and then stores the data of these features. A facial recognition system will use biometrics to map the face and compare it with a database to find a match. Using face detection, face capture, and face match, this technology analyzes over 80 elements of the human face. Requires little interaction with the device. It is widely used and people are used to this type of technology. Highly effective and very little setup. No need to memorise complex passwords. Facial recognition is among the more convenient biometric authentication modalities. Looking into the device's camera involves less friction than a fingerprint scan or authentication code. Not all facial recognition systems are created equally. Some are easier to spoof than others. Device-native solutions are not as effective as third-party or proprietary solutions. homebase's face recognition SaaS solution is made and patented in Germany and equipped with an anti-spoofing technology and liveness detection to eliminate bypassing of the biometrics. With its 3-step onboarding process and easy setup, your company's data could be protected in no time. Contact our team now for a free demo.
