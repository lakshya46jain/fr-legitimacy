A set of anti-fraud features for remote customer registration, authentication and identification. It can be used at any user journey stage, including payment transactions. Biometric verification of a large number of duplicates (Search and Face Matching 1:N) Biometric verification of a large number of duplicates (Search and Face Matching 1:N) Document Authenticity — Scanning and detection of document fakes. Training to recognize any type of document. Digital documents (*available in Kazakhstan). Document Authenticity — Scanning and detection of document fakes. Training to recognize any type of document. Digital documents (*available in Kazakhstan). Liveness Detection — Short video recording, detection of the customer's face, presence of unauthorized persons and other features. Recording can be exported to the customer's CRM. Liveness Detection — Short video recording, detection of the customer's face, presence of unauthorized persons and other features. Recording can be exported to the customer's CRM. Bot and attack protection The antibot system is used by communication services between real people. Bots, especially in mobile apps are increasingly attacking recruitment, dating, and training platforms. Face comparison — the user's selfie is compared to a reference image, which is stored in a trusted database, or extracted from a document.
