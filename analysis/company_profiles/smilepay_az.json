Face detection and face recognition is processed on the SmilePay app installed point of sale device and, your photo or video file is not saved on any server for our face recognition process to function (except one image stored in cloud server based in Azerbaijan by 15 days to protect user rights and solve mis payment problems). Your biometric face template is a unique unidentifiable and encrypted data that we use to match your real-time video capture image with your SmilePay account at the point of purchase directly on the SmilePay app installed point of sale device.
