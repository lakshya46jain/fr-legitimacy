    "IT Product Line Card Mailing and Remit Addresses Timonium , Maryland October 9,2003 — James Rainey, FSO and VP of IT Services for CyberCore Technologies packaged a solid technology solution to streamline construction site communications, saving time and preventing lengthy delays. At the job site, construction engineers often require clarification or interpretation from the building architects. Architects often need to update drawings for the site to reflect their client's change in priorities. Messengers running from site to airport and even next day delivery causes work stoppage with associated costs. Imagine being able to send drawings, photos, and videos for a major construction project instantly between site and designers. Too expensive, too slow, and too much technology for Architectural and Construction Engineering (AEC)? Not when Hitt Contracting began building the American Urological Association Headquarters, in Linthicum Heights MD. Founded as a family business in 1937, HITT Contracting has grown to rank among the Top 100 General Contractors worldwide. They selected the solution engineered by AEC World .NETworks. Formed by a partnership between CyberCore Technologies and the Aristotle Institute (AI), AEC World .NETworks delivers a wireless solution to construction sites. Using AI's patented multi-media communication technology deployed in an encrypted wireless hot spot engineered and equipped by CyberCore Technologies, communication is instantaneous. AEC World .NETworks' Universal Connectivity and Communications systems (UCC); provides construction organizations with wireless connectivity and high-impact communications. This turnkey solution enables non-technical AEC professionals to provide practical communications, including pictures and narration to owners and AEC professionals; regardless of their location, connection, or equipment. Breaking the communication barriers, AEC World .NETworks is attracting interest from insurance and financial companies that back these construction projects. \"We project our construction communication solution sales to hit $3.3 million annually, \" commented Jim Rainey. \"It delivers not only improved communications with owners and clients, but provides an accurate history of construction archived for instant review. In addition, our clients are realizing $50,000 annual savings in printing at their trailer. ### .",
