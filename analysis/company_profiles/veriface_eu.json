    "The Know Your Customer and Identity Verification processes are designed to help reduce the risks of illegal activity by identifying and verifying the identification of players, while suspicious persons and potentially high-risk players may be monitored or banned. Identity verification requirements in online gambling Online gambling businesses must comply with anti-fraud laws, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). That means apps and online gambling sites must follow strict measures. Otherwise, they're risking huge fines for non-compliance. There are 3 main reasons why online gambling companies ask for identity verification: To confirm the client's identity To check the gambler's age To look into self-excluded individuals To meet safety requirements, online gambling companies must ask their clients to prove their identity and age before they start gambling. If the customer were asked to complete identity verification earlier, they typically wouldn't need to re-verify themselves. Despite that, there are some exceptions for additional AML checks. Know Your Customer in online gambling Due to Customer Due Diligence (CDD), online gambling institutions must gather and assess customers' or potential customers' data. The rules are here for a reason. Taking steps to ensure CDD helps online gambling institutions prevent criminals from using their apps as a channel for money laundering activities. There are 3 focal CDD rule points that online gambling businesses need to follow: To verify the customers' identities To explore customers' relationships and develop risk profiles To screen and monitor suspicious behavioral patterns and customers' transactions For example, what happens when an online casino fails to ensure compliance? In this case, the company receives requests to take action immediately. Without positive results, state authorities can fine or ban online casinos from operating at all. Fraud in online gambling Online gambling attracts many fraudsters and organized crime gangs. There's no surprise here. As more consumers shift their gambling habits to the digital sphere, the fraud problem intensifies. Stolen identities and fake identity documents aren't the only fraudulent tools that criminals use to spin off money. The impact of fraud in online gambling There are multiple risk factors for fraud. Online gambling scams can grow into serious AML compliance issues. With non-compliance consequences comes a lousy reputation. Business partners and investors are more likely to be skeptical when putting their money into unreliable organizations. Online gambling businesses that are known for high fraud levels are also more likely to lose customers. The future of identity verification in online gambling It's not arguable that security measures, including identity verification, are important for the online gambling industry. Traditional casino operators are losing customers due to complex, time-consuming authentication processes. In the meantime, digital identity verification solutions improve the players' confidence in gambling services without them having to wait for their identity approval for hours or even weeks. It's now an industry standard to automate this process. All it takes is 2 steps for the player: To upload a photo of their identity document To add a selfie during the onboarding to confirm whether they're legitimate Considering the risks in gambling, digital identity verification measures solve two main issues. That means online gambling platforms can now offer great customer service along with complete security and easier compliance insurance.
