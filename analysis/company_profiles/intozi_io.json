    "Yellow Box Violation Detection To ensure hassle-free traffic movement through intersections Yellow Box Violation Detection System The solution is meant for traffic intersections to detect the violations and ensure hassle free traffic movement through intersections. Automatically track the vehicles Violating the yellow BOX rule and capture the video of violation along with images and vehicle number as evidence. Highly efficient Intozi's ANPR engine is capable of reading the vehicle numbers of all the vehicles with great accuracy. Key Features Yellow Box Violation Detection Video recording of the event of violation as evidence. Highly accurate automatic number plate recognition engine. Instant Alerts for Hotlisted vehicles Support up to 4 Lanes Vehicle Volume Analysis Centralized dashboard for remote monitoring and analysis Lane jumping or Wrong Lane driving detection HIGHLIGHTS Enter The Junction Box Only If Your Exit Road Is Clear. A yellow box junction allows through traffic to pass freely and ensures that fire engines always have a clear exit from fire stations by ensuring there is a clear road space for them to use. When can I enter a yellow box? Box junctions are generally only accessible if oncoming traffic or other vehicles trying to turn right block your way. If you enter an intersection with traffic lights, keep in mind that the lights must be in your favor while you are making your right turn. KEY POINTS Improved traffic flow: By reducing the number of yellow box violations, the system can help improve traffic flow and reduce congestion at busy intersections. Increased safety: Yellow box violations can lead to accidents, particularly when pedestrians or other vehicles are crossing the intersection. By detecting and preventing these violations, the system can help increase safety for all road users. Automated enforcement: The system can use cameras and other sensors to automatically detect yellow box violations, without the need for manual enforcement by police officers. Real-time monitoring: The system can provide real-time monitoring of traffic flow and violations, allowing for rapid response to any issues or emergencies. Customizable settings: The system can be customized to fit the specific needs and traffic patterns of different intersections, allowing for maximum effectiveness. Reduced costs: By automating enforcement and reducing the number of accidents, the system can help reduce costs associated with manual enforcement and emergency response. Data analysis: The system can collect and analyze data on traffic patterns and violations, providing insights that can be used to further improve intersection design and traffic management.
