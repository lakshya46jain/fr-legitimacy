In 3Q'22, the Group's total revenue grew materially showing strong double-digit percentage growth year-on-year , supported by continuous customer base expansion. Interest income increased by 19% year-on-year to RUB 50.9 bn in 3Q'22 (3Q'21: RUB 42.9 bn), driven by the higher base of our loan portfolio helped by 2021 expansion, increase of the customer base and expansion of the credit product range. Gross loan interest yield decreased slightly year-on-year following trend of the previous years. The interest yield on the Group's securities portfolio slightly increased due to higher rates in bond and money markets. In 3Q'22, interest expense rose by 82% year-on-year to RUB 13.2 bn (3Q'21: RUB 7.3 bn), driven by a marked increase in our cost of borrowing, owing to the monetary policy environment, as well as an expanded base of the customer funds.

Cost of risk increased materially year-on-year in 9M'22 owing to conservative macro-related provisioning and was close to our long-term average level of around 10%. In 3Q'22, our total operating expenses increased 32% y-o-y to RUB 34.1 bn (3Q'21: RUB 25.8 bn) driven by our continued investment into our IT talent and capability to support our growing product range and customer base. Our customer acquisition expenses were broadly stable despite growing customer base as we significantly rationalised our marketing and advertising spend. Our non-credit business lines continue to deliver an increasing share of our revenue and bottom line thanks to growth of the customer base, our widened range of product offerings and continued monetisation efforts. The Group remained profitable in 9M22 with net profit of RUB 10.1 bn (9M'21: RUB 46.8 bn). In 3Q'22 our net profit was RUB 5.9 bn (3Q'21: RUB 16.5 bn), decreasing 64% year-on-year , primarily impacted by growth in funding costs and conservative provisioning.

Oliver Hughes, CEO, commented: \"I'm happy to report that 2019 was another year of record-high profit, underpinned by the strength of both our credit and non-credit business lines. We saw 4.3 million new credit accounts opened in 2019 with net loans rising 66%, even as we retained our conservative approach to lending. Current accounts grew by 57% to 7.1 million, underpinned by the popularity of our lifestyle and financial ecosystem. Tinkoff Investments made new strides, bringing more than 800 thousand new retail investors to Moscow Exchange in 2019, more than any other brokerage, as customers responded well to the straightforward, seamless approach to investing our tech solutions allow. As the popularity of our investment offering continued to grow, we added more options for traders to interact with one another within the app. We've also decided to launch Russia's first commission-free exchange-traded fund (ETF) through Tinkoff Capital, the management company within our ecosystem. We continued to innovate on the tech front, taking the next step in our ecosystem approach by launching Russia's first SuperApp. Now, customers can take care of nearly all of their lifestyle and financial needs, ranging from booking medical appointments to reserving restaurant tables and making bank transfers with just a few easy clicks without leaving the Tinkoff app. While continuing to innovate, we remain one of the most profitable banks in the world, with ROE at 55.9% for 2019 and continue to focus on our bottom line as we expand our lifestyle and financial offering. This year we're also undertaking one of our greatest marketing efforts, signing a title partnership agreement with the Russian Football Premier League. We hope this will help us further build customer loyalty, attract new customers and provide expanded possibilities for purchasing football tickets within the Tinkoff SuperApp.†FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REVIEW RUB bn 4 Q ' 1 9 4 Q ' 1 8 Change FY' 1 9 FY' 1 8 Change Credit accounts acquired (mn pcs) 1.1 1.0 +10% 4.3 2.7 +59% Net margin 24.0 16.1 +49% 86.8 60.0 +45% Net margin after provisions 16.3 13.8 +18% 59.7 48.2 +24% Profit before tax 13.4 10.5 +28% 45.5 35.2 +29% Net income 11.0 8.1 +36% 36.1 27.1 +33% Return on equity 49.0% 81.2% -32.2 p.p. 55.9% 74.7% -18.8 p.p.

We saw 4.3 million new credit accounts opened in 2019 with net loans rising 66%, even as we retained our conservative approach to lending. Current accounts grew by 57% to 7.1 million, underpinned by the popularity of our lifestyle and financial ecosystem. Tinkoff Investments made new strides, bringing more than 800 thousand new retail investors to Moscow Exchange in 2019, more than any other brokerage, as customers responded well to the straightforward, seamless approach to investing our tech solutions allow. As the popularity of our investment offering continued to grow, we added more options for traders to interact with one another within the app. We've also decided to launch Russia's first commission-free exchange-traded fund (ETF) through Tinkoff Capital, the management company within our ecosystem. We continued to innovate on the tech front, taking the next step in our ecosystem approach by launching Russia's first SuperApp. Now, customers can take care of nearly all of their lifestyle and financial needs, ranging from booking medical appointments to reserving restaurant tables and making bank transfers with just a few easy clicks without leaving the Tinkoff app. While continuing to innovate, we remain one of the most profitable banks in the world, with ROE at 55.9% for 2019 and continue to focus on our bottom line as we expand our lifestyle and financial offering. This year we're also undertaking one of our greatest marketing efforts, signing a title partnership agreement with the Russian Football Premier League. We hope this will help us further build customer loyalty, attract new customers and provide expanded possibilities for purchasing football tickets within the Tinkoff SuperApp.†FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REVIEW 4 Q ' 1 9 4 Q ' 1 8 Credit accounts acquired (mn pcs) Net margin after provisions Net loans and advances to customers Cash and treasury portfolio Tier 1 capital ratio CBR N1.0 (capital adequacy ratio) In 4Q'19, the Group's total revenue grew by 45% y-o-y to RUB 46.7 bn (4Q'18: RUB 32.3 bn).
