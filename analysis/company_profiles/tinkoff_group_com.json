Interest income increased by 19% year-on-year to RUB 50.9 bn in 3Q'22 (3Q'21: RUB 42.9 bn), driven by the higher base of our loan portfolio helped by 2021 expansion, increase of the customer base and expansion of the credit product range.

Our customer acquisition expenses were broadly stable despite growing customer base as we significantly rationalised our marketing and advertising spend.
