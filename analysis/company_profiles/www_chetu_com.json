    "Let's Talk ! 954 342 5676 +44 137 243 2466 عربي (AR) English (EN) English (UK) Español Chetu Defines Robust Web Services Development Web services are the solution for ensuring disparate applications communicate with each other in a stateless way. We program RESTful APIs to interface and integrate numerous apps, protocols and services together across your entire web app ecosystem. From IoT devices to mobile apps and anything in between, our programming scales to any size business. Web Service Protocols and Interfacing We utilize web services to improve application interoperability. Our expertise includes SOAP solutions with Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) interfaces, XML and sharing of resources, data, business logic, documents, programs, messages, and objects, using both peer-to-peer and client-server models. Web Services Scalable Architecture We engineer Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) for scalable enterprise systems in order to accelerate business processes and limit IT bottlenecks. We build web service providers, brokers, and consumers that conform to standardized service contracts and possess abstraction, autonomy, and granularity. Our comprehensive SOA solutions include legacy system appraisals, electronic data interchange (EDI) services, migrations , and enterprise service bus (ESB) implementations. Programming SOAP Web Services We program custom Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) web services with straightforward Web Services Description Language (WSDL) interfaces, designed for distributed and extensible web servers that are platform-, language-, and transport-independent. We program SOAP web services for more comprehensive enterprise systems that require Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID) compliance, as well as advanced security and communication capabilities. Programming RESTful Web Service APIs We program RESTful APIs using HTTP protocols and JSON data , for stateless client-server web services that are browser agnostic and cacheable. We use REST when developing data-driven applications, social media integrations, mobile apps, and tools that require substantial scalability, stable performance, and the ability to efficiently reconfigure code. Programming JSON Web Service APIs We program custom JSON generators and JSON APIs that implement language-independent, lightweight web services, representing robust object and array data structures. We use JSON programming for web apps and mobile apps to transmit structured, serialized database connections. We also use JSON solutions alongside AJAX applications and RESTful web services.

Web Services Tools Restlet We use the Restlet framework to build RESTful web APIs with Java . Restlet offers comprehensive routing and filtering abilities, platform interoperability, and the API Spark platform as a system (PaaS) for establishing software developer's kits (SDKs). Spring We develop web apps using the Spring web service toolkit. We engineer RESTful APIs and web services (Spring Boot), implement web-based microservices (Spring Cloud), and establish database pipelines (Spring Cloud Data Flow). Jersey We program REStful solutions, and their correlated Java clients, using the Jersey web framework and JAX-RS API to abstract simplified client-server communication and expose data to different platforms. Swagger We implement custom web APIs using Swagger's OpenAPI Specification (OAS) tools. These tools help in designing UIs, programming code, documenting services, debugging, testing, and full deployment. We use the Restlet framework to build RESTful web APIs with Java .

Web Testing Postman We use the language-independent Postman REST client, its feature-rich interface, and its Google Chrome plugin to perform automated and exploratory API testing. Rest-Assured Our team utilizes REST-Assured's Java DSL for seamless automated testing of HTTP-based RESTful APIs. Rest-Assured supports XML and JSON requests, and integrates well with Serenity for UI testing. HttpMaster We leverage the dynamic parameter capabilities of the HttpMaster development tool, which automates testing for API calls, and websites using many different data types. SoapUI We implement comprehensive QA testing of APIs using SoapUI tools, including drag-and-drop test-building, asynchronous testing, Mock Service mirroring, and Groovy code creation.
