    "FOLLOW US ON LINKEDIN A TECHNOLOGIES FOR INCLUSION COMPANY TECH5 BIOMETRIC MODALITIES FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION Fingerprint to establish or confirm a person's identity is one of the oldest techniques used in the world of biometrics. This modality has gained huge popularity. Nowadays we use for unlocking smart phones, to login our computers or getting access to physically secure environment. It is based on the concept of taking an image of our fingerprint and compare to another fingerprint image or database of images. IRIS RECOGNITION They say that the eye is the window to the soul. For sure the Iris, the coloured portion of the eye, represents the key to what is generally considered as one the most accurate and reliable biometric modalities. First patented in 1987, Iris Recognition is now widely used in National Identification programs as well as for personal identity confirmation on personal devices. FACE RECOGNITION Face Recognition is becoming the most popular biometric technology due to the significant accuracy improvement using Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Neural Networks). Excellent matching performance even with extreme poses, lighting conditions, expressions and age differences makes it the perfect technology for forensic applications, ID solutions and mobile authentication uses cases.

    "Year in Review Biometrics Feb 4, 2020 | All News , Interviews The FindBiometrics Year in Review is a massive industry event, collecting the opinions of biometrics industry experts from a wide range of backgrounds. Each year our industry survey checks the industry pulse on the popularity of biometric modalities, the excitement around specific vertical markets, and attitudes toward critical industry issues like privacy, regulation and public perception. 2019 survey collected responses from over 230 industry experts, and the analysis of the results thus far has been enlightening as set the stage for a new decade of biometrics . To balance out the larger industry discussion, it's time to take a look at how 2019 was for many of the companies that participated in the Year in Review. FindBiometrics reached out to survey respondents, asking for a snapshot of their year, their opinions on industry opportunities, and what we can expect so see from them in 2020. In part one of our multi-part series, we are profiling answers from Aerendir, TECH5 , and Hitachi. What was your company's biggest accomplishment in 2019? TECH5's biggest achievement in 2019 was that we have been successful in scaling our technologies, extending our reach to national scale ID programs with total database sizes of 100 million and upward in of number of records. This has been one of our key objectives. In 2019 we have successfully deployed our face recognition systems in Asia with a total database of 250 million. What is the greatest opportunity facing the biometrics industry? A key opportunity that we have in front of us in the biometrics industry is to capitalize fully on the pervasive use of mobile devices. Mobile platforms more and more represent the preferred touch-point and communication channel between customers and service providers, from opening bank accounts in a digital onboarding process up to storing ones key credentials such as a driver's license or national ID card. Implementing both capture technology across biometrics as well as liveness detection functionality on a standard mobile device will open up significant opportunities for the industry in the areas of registration, authentication, and identification services. What does your company have in store for 2020? We have a great number of exciting events and product launches in store for 2020. We will unveil TECH5 EagleEye, our new surveillance offering building on TECH5 top performing Face Recognition technology. We are already getting many enquirers for this new platform targeting a very fast growing biometric application segment. Secondly, we will launch several new mobile biometrics applications suites tailored to mobile registration, digital onboarding, and customer authentication. Finally, we will have direct presence at key shows like ID4Africa to be held in Morocco at the beginning of June of 2020, as well as Identity Week London and Singapore, where we invite our customers and contacts to meet us and be briefed on they can benefit from TECH5 products and solutions tailored to their needs.
