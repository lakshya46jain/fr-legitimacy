    "Let's be honest. Being a smaller football club can feel like a tough match, both on and off the pitch. Budgets are tight and trying something new can be scary. But here's the thing. While the big clubs chase global fame, smaller clubs still have something powerful: a strong community. Take the 2. Bundesliga, Germany's second division, for example. On average, their stadiums attract more fans than France's first division. How? The answer lies in a football culture built around community and tradition. People return week after week because they feel part of something bigger than themselves. However, times are changing. That loyal fanbase is aging. If younger generations do not feel connected now, who will fill your stands in ten years? Empty seats mean missed revenue and lost atmosphere. Fan engagement is the key to tackling these challenges. It helps you keep loyal supporters close, attract younger fans, and make every matchday feel like part of something bigger. In the next sections, we will show how other clubs are doing this successfully and how smaller clubs can make it their biggest strength. An aging fanbase clubs can't ignore One of the biggest challenges for football clubs today is an aging fanbase. Yet, many clubs are not paying attention to it. The stands still fill up and on the surface, everything seems fine. But under that surface, the problem grows. If younger generations do not connect with your club now, who will come to your stadium in 10 years? The numbers speak for themselves. In the UK, only 30% of people aged 18 to 34 feel passionate about football. Besides, even more than a third don't really care that much about football. It is not that young fans don't like sports at all; they just consume sports differently. They want quick highlights, behind-the-scenes content, and interaction beyond just watching a match. According to PwC , Gen Z fans are far more likely to follow football through social media and digital platforms rather than rooting in the stands. This is where technology comes in. Younger fans expect seamless, hassle-free experiences. They don't want to fumble with paper tickets or even QR codes. Biometric ticketing fits naturally into their digital mindset, allowing them to enter the stadium effortlessly, just like they unlock their phones. An important factor for the younger generation is to make everything go faster. With a biometric solution, fans can enter the stadium up to 3x faster. Still, many clubs remain conservative. They like to stick to old habits, afraid to change what once worked well. That hesitation is dangerous, as younger generations expect more. They want entertainment and a reason to feel part of something. For smaller clubs, this challenge becomes even bigger. Unlike top clubs, they cannot rely on occasional fans or tourists. However, this also means they have the chance to build something stronger. As a smaller club, a close connection with the local community is the biggest strength. With the right fan engagement strategies, they can make younger fans feel part of the club's story and turn them into loyal supporters for years to come. When mindset beats money It is possible to do things differently. Some clubs have shown that you don't need the biggest budget or the best players to stand out. They have shown that it is important to have a look off the pitch. Still, it is not that simple. You need creativity and courage, putting extra focus on your fans. 2. Bundesliga This league has become Europe's most-attended second division , even surpassing France's first league. The reason? A clear fan-first approach. Ticket prices stay affordable and stadiums feel welcoming for families and all supporters. Their famous 50 plus 1 rule keeps clubs in the hands of their fans, meaning decisions are made for the people who matter most. Fans are not treated as passive customers but as active participants in the club's story. FC Slovan Liberec Another example is this smaller Czech club focusing on connecting with their younger fanbase . However, instead of giving exclusive content to reporters, Slovan Liberec has taken control of their own storytelling. Their behind-the-scenes series, player stories, and exclusive content are now available through their own platform, creating a direct line to fans while also generating revenue. By keeping key content behind a paywall, they ensure that engagement translates into both loyalty and financial support, proving that smart digital strategies can make a real difference for smaller clubs. Venezia FC Then there is also the Italian club Venezia FC , which has turned their club into a fashionable brand. Although being one of the most famous touristic cities in Europe, they had a hard time getting the home crowd behind them and had no international appeal. They recognized the need for change and shifted their priority from on-field performance to off-the-pitch engagement. By collaborating with designers and focusing on style, they wanted to tell a story that goes beyond football. Their creative and unique approach attracted global attention and cultivated a loyal fanbase. They clearly proved that out-of-the-box thinking can lead to lasting success. These examples show what smaller clubs can achieve when they think differently and put fan engagement at the center of everything. It is not about size but about mindset. Using data to boost fan engagement Strong fan engagement starts with knowing who your fans are and what they care about. Data allows clubs to understand who their supporters are and what they care about. With the right data, clubs can personalize the fan experience. You can send targeted offers, invite the right people to events, and create content that speaks to each group. Fans do not want to feel like one of many. Just like regular customers, fans want to feel seen and valued. Moreover, it is also a key aspect of marketing. Small clubs do not have endless budgets. Therefore, smart, data-driven marketing helps them reach the right fans with the right message at the right time. This increases ticket sales, boosts merchandise revenue, making each euro spent more effective. In fact, leveraging fan data effectively has proven to be a game-changer in maximizing matchday revenue . However, the challenge lies in collecting and using this data efficiently without adding friction to the fan experience. With the right tools, clubs can streamline this process, ensuring they not only boost revenue but also strengthen fan engagement in the long run. On top of that, data also plays a crucial role when dealing with partners. Sponsors and commercial partners want more than a logo on a shirt. They want to know who your fans are. What do they buy? Which brands do they follow? What drives their loyalty? If you cannot answer those questions, you are missing opportunities. European giant nearly dropped the ball on this. Even the biggest clubs struggle with this. FC Barcelona signed a €280 million sponsorship deal with Spotify. But according to Sport , Spotify was disappointed to gain access to data from less than 1 percent of Barcelona's claimed 350 million registered supporters. This lack of real data made it harder to activate the sponsorship and deliver value. For smaller clubs, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. You may not have millions of fans, but you can really know them well. Collecting the right data and using it wisely can help you build stronger fan relationships and become more attractive to sponsors. In the end, good data makes everything you do smarter. Why bold moves matter more than big budgets The future belongs to clubs that are willing to evolve. Smaller clubs do not need massive budgets or superstar squads to make an impact. They need focus. Focus on their community and most importantly, their fans. By adapting to new expectations and staying creative, smaller clubs can build something that lasts. Innovation doesn't always mean huge investments. It often starts with smarter choices. For example, using data to better understand fan behavior, offering more personalized experiences, and finding new ways to keep fans engaged beyond matchdays. One of the most important factors is making fan experiences seamless. By embracing innovation and implementing technologies such as biometric ticketing, clubs can enhance the fan journey. Entry becomes fast and smooth, while also offering a more secure experience. In the end, it all comes down to fan engagement In today's competitive football landscape, fan engagement is the key to ensuring long-term success, especially for smaller clubs. By focusing on building strong connections with your fans and understanding what they want, you can create a loyal fanbase that returns game after game. Leveraging data and innovation, including solutions like TruCrowd's identity technology , allows clubs to better understand fan behavior and deliver personalized experiences. Embracing such technologies helps streamline the fan journey, providing a smoother, more secure experience while keeping fans engaged both on and off the pitch. Don't sit back and watch other clubs innovate. Start small and think big, because the future isn't waiting. The time to invest in fan engagement and innovative strategies is now.

Which brands do they follow? What drives their loyalty? If you cannot answer those questions, you are missing opportunities. European giant nearly dropped the ball on this. Even the biggest clubs struggle with this. FC Barcelona signed a €280 million sponsorship deal with Spotify. But according to Sport , Spotify was disappointed to gain access to data from less than 1 percent of Barcelona's claimed 350 million registered supporters. This lack of real data made it harder to activate the sponsorship and deliver value. For smaller clubs, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. You may not have millions of fans, but you can really know them well. Collecting the right data and using it wisely can help you build stronger fan relationships and become more attractive to sponsors. In the end, good data makes everything you do smarter. Why bold moves matter more than big budgets The future belongs to clubs that are willing to evolve. Smaller clubs do not need massive budgets or superstar squads to make an impact. They need focus. Focus on their community and most importantly, their fans. By adapting to new expectations and staying creative, smaller clubs can build something that lasts. Innovation doesn't always mean huge investments. It often starts with smarter choices. For example, using data to better understand fan behavior, offering more personalized experiences, and finding new ways to keep fans engaged beyond matchdays. One of the most important factors is making fan experiences seamless. By embracing innovation and implementing technologies such as biometric ticketing, clubs can enhance the fan journey. Entry becomes fast and smooth, while also offering a more secure experience. In the end, it all comes down to fan engagement In today's competitive football landscape, fan engagement is the key to ensuring long-term success, especially for smaller clubs. By focusing on building strong connections with your fans and understanding what they want, you can create a loyal fanbase that returns game after game. Leveraging data and innovation, including solutions like TruCrowd's identity technology , allows clubs to better understand fan behavior and deliver personalized experiences. Embracing such technologies helps streamline the fan journey, providing a smoother, more secure experience while keeping fans engaged both on and off the pitch. Don't sit back and watch other clubs innovate. Start small and think big, because the future isn't waiting. The time to invest in fan engagement and innovative strategies is now. Let's be honest. Being a smaller football club can feel like a tough match, both on and off the pitch. Budgets are tight and trying something new can be scary. But here's the thing. While the big clubs chase global fame, smaller clubs still have something powerful: a strong community. Take the 2. Bundesliga, Germany's second division, for example. On average, their stadiums attract more fans than France's first division. How? The answer lies in a football culture built around community and tradition. People return week after week because they feel part of something bigger than themselves. However, times are changing. That loyal fanbase is aging. If younger generations do not feel connected now, who will fill your stands in ten years? Empty seats mean missed revenue and lost atmosphere. Fan engagement is the key to tackling these challenges. It helps you keep loyal supporters close, attract younger fans, and make every matchday feel like part of something bigger. In the next sections, we will show how other clubs are doing this successfully and how smaller clubs can make it their biggest strength. An aging fanbase clubs can't ignore One of the biggest challenges for football clubs today is an aging fanbase. Yet, many clubs are not paying attention to it. The stands still fill up and on the surface, everything seems fine. But under that surface, the problem grows. If younger generations do not connect with your club now, who will come to your stadium in 10 years? The numbers speak for themselves. In the UK, only 30% of people aged 18 to 34 feel passionate about football. Besides, even more than a third don't really care that much about football. It is not that young fans don't like sports at all; they just consume sports differently. They want quick highlights, behind-the-scenes content, and interaction beyond just watching a match. According to PwC , Gen Z fans are far more likely to follow football through social media and digital platforms rather than rooting in the stands. This is where technology comes in. Younger fans expect seamless, hassle-free experiences. They don't want to fumble with paper tickets or even QR codes. Biometric ticketing fits naturally into their digital mindset, allowing them to enter the stadium effortlessly, just like they unlock their phones. An important factor for the younger generation is to make everything go faster. With a biometric solution, fans can enter the stadium up to 3x faster. Still, many clubs remain conservative. They like to stick to old habits, afraid to change what once worked well. That hesitation is dangerous, as younger generations expect more. They want entertainment and a reason to feel part of something. For smaller clubs, this challenge becomes even bigger. Unlike top clubs, they cannot rely on occasional fans or tourists. However, this also means they have the chance to build something stronger. As a smaller club, a close connection with the local community is the biggest strength. With the right fan engagement strategies, they can make younger fans feel part of the club's story and turn them into loyal supporters for years to come. When mindset beats money It is possible to do things differently. Some clubs have shown that you don't need the biggest budget or the best players to stand out. They have shown that it is important to have a look off the pitch. Still, it is not that simple. You need creativity and courage, putting extra focus on your fans. This league has become Europe's most-attended second division , even surpassing France's first league. The reason? A clear fan-first approach. Ticket prices stay affordable and stadiums feel welcoming for families and all supporters. Their famous 50 plus 1 rule keeps clubs in the hands of their fans, meaning decisions are made for the people who matter most. Fans are not treated as passive customers but as active participants in the club's story. Another example is this smaller Czech club focusing on connecting with their younger fanbase . However, instead of giving exclusive content to reporters, Slovan Liberec has taken control of their own storytelling. Their behind-the-scenes series, player stories, and exclusive content are now available through their own platform, creating a direct line to fans while also generating revenue. By keeping key content behind a paywall, they ensure that engagement translates into both loyalty and financial support, proving that smart digital strategies can make a real difference for smaller clubs. Then there is also the Italian club Venezia FC , which has turned their club into a fashionable brand. Although being one of the most famous touristic cities in Europe, they had a hard time getting the home crowd behind them and had no international appeal. They recognized the need for change and shifted their priority from on-field performance to off-the-pitch engagement. By collaborating with designers and focusing on style, they wanted to tell a story that goes beyond football. Their creative and unique approach attracted global attention and cultivated a loyal fanbase. They clearly proved that out-of-the-box thinking can lead to lasting success. These examples show what smaller clubs can achieve when they think differently and put fan engagement at the center of everything. It is not about size but about mindset. Using data to boost fan engagement Strong fan engagement starts with knowing who your fans are and what they care about. Data allows clubs to understand who their supporters are and what they care about. With the right data, clubs can personalize the fan experience. You can send targeted offers, invite the right people to events, and create content that speaks to each group. Fans do not want to feel like one of many. Just like regular customers, fans want to feel seen and valued. Moreover, it is also a key aspect of marketing. Small clubs do not have endless budgets. Therefore, smart, data-driven marketing helps them reach the right fans with the right message at the right time. This increases ticket sales, boosts merchandise revenue, making each euro spent more effective. In fact, leveraging fan data effectively has proven to be a game-changer in maximizing matchday revenue . However, the challenge lies in collecting and using this data efficiently without adding friction to the fan experience. With the right tools, clubs can streamline this process, ensuring they not only boost revenue but also strengthen fan engagement in the long run. On top of that, data also plays a crucial role when dealing with partners. Sponsors and commercial partners want more than a logo on a shirt. They want to know who your fans are. What do they buy? Which brands do they follow? What drives their loyalty? If you cannot answer those questions, you are missing opportunities. Even the biggest clubs struggle with this.

    "Regulations require sports clubs to verify the identities of ticket purchasers, but current methods for checking IDs at stadium gates are ineffective. This creates a problematic gap: clubs are held accountable for who enters, but lack the tools to enforce it. Facial recognition at stadiums, while currently banned for access control, offers a solution to this security conundrum. One point where facial recognition at stadiums can get confusing is its role. It aims to replace two different functions at once: access and security. For access, it allows the use of a face as a ticket, eliminating the need to carry any ticket. For security purposes, its role is akin to that of security staff: it checks whether a person is a known hooligan or a fraudster. It performs this task more quickly and accurately than any person ever could, resulting in virtually zero errors. Any error could lead to a security incident, a fine for the club , or both—not to mention negative coverage of the game and perceived insecurity of the venue. Let's look at these two roles of facial recognition in more detail. Role 1: Your Face is Your Ticket To verify the identity of a ticket holder at the entrance gate, the spectator does not need any ticket or token. The face, and only the face, is literally the ticket. The venue owner or club doesn't need to know the name or any other personally identifiable information. They just use the image of a face to check whether a given person has indeed bought a ticket. Facial recognition is being considered by football clubs with great interest. It's no surprise—the benefits can easily outweigh the costs. The technology promises to eliminate fines for unruly fans, prevent hooliganism and fights at the stadium, and consequently attract 10% to 15% more families to stadiums, as estimated by Lorin Parys, CEO of the Pro League. \"There is a hard core of 2 to 3 percent of the spectators – I don't want to call them fans – who are holding our football hostage today. We want that 2 to 3 percent out of our stadiums, because then we will grow 10 to 15 percent in spectator numbers. These are families with children who are staying away today. We want to make stadiums safe again.†Lorin Parys, CEO of the Pro League Additionally, it can reduce long waiting lines and dangerous bottlenecks, and eradicate fake tickets or overpriced reselling . Fans are also receptive to this idea. Contrary to fears about their faces being \"stolen\" and misused, existing deployments show that fans are seeking security, comfort, and fair pricing. Role 2: Security Without Mistakes The security aspect is promoted mostly by federations and regulators that require clubs to verify the identities of ticket buyers and to authorize the entry to the stadium upon presentation of a valid Ticket per person (regardless of age) and proof of identity of the Ticket Holder with valid photograph ( UEFA UEFA EURO 2024â\"¢TICKETING ) . Simply, they should know who is at the stadium during events. This is not for faster access or more accurate fan data; it's to limit the security threats posed by unruly fans and other external threats, such as terrorism, that all mass events unfortunately face. Unlike using facial recognition as a face ticket for stadium access, using it to prevent security incidents, eliminate racism, or keep dangerous individuals out of stadiums requires associating the face with personally identifiable information. Achieving the security requirements set by regulators without facial recognition technology is nearly impossible. Manual identity checks at the stadium gates would involve staff verifying ticket names against IDs and matching faces to ID photos, which is less accurate than biometrics. It would also result in longer waiting lines and more risky bottlenecks. Not to mention the risks of false positives and negatives. In the first case, security could detain innocent persons due to a suspicious name or behavior, according to staff judgment. In the second case, failure to identify a known hooligan due to a false ID means security and financial risks. Both of these risks are not only minimized with biometrics but can also be precisely measured and easily mitigated, resulting in virtually no errors. Currently, despite the requirements, these identity checks are not effectively enforced. This creates a situation where important rules are in place but are impractical to implement without technological support. The Privacy Dilemma The main concern preventing the full adoption of facial recognition is privacy and GDPR compliance . Clubs face a tradeoff between creating a safe experience for their fans, avoiding issues like racism and vandalism, and protecting their privacy. GDPR stipulates that less intrusive methods of identification should be used if available. While paper tickets are less intrusive for access control, they do not represent an alternative for reducing security risks at mass events like facial recognition. While the right to privacy is certainly one of the most important pillars of a free society, it is also important to measure the true risks related to each of these two use cases. Data Breaches It is true that to implement a face ticket solution, the faces or biometric templates of attendees must be captured and stored in a database for matching at the entrance gate. It is also true that these faces do not have to be kept in the same system as all other personal data, such as names, addresses, … The privacy-proof solution design keeps these two datasets separated, thereby mitigating the risk. The solutions providing face identification services also operate on high-security software architecture that complies with the strictest data protection requirements. It is also important to acknowledge that there have been no confirmed cases of full-blown identity theft solely from a leaked facial recognition database as most entities will require liveness checks for opening bank accounts and other tasks. The primary risk associated with a facial database breach is the possibility for malicious actors to combine leaked facial data with other publicly available information to create a more complete profile. Needless to say, the main sources of this public information are social networks that already contain both faces and publicly available personal information. Identification in Public Areas Another significant concern is the identification of individuals in public areas. This issue rightfully ranks among the most feared abuses of facial recognition technology. Particularly detrimental to democracy and human rights, it is extensively covered and discussed in the world's only AI regulation, the AI Act . It is also true that for face ticket systems to function, faces need to be identified, and cameras are positioned at the stadium gates. The identification is possible only against a list of individuals who have opted in for such identification. Most importantly, the ethical aspect of protecting other individuals that did not want their faces scanned is addressed at the technological level. A properly designed face ticket solution has the capability to restrict the exact area within the camera's view where identification occurs, with accuracy down to tens of centimeters. This designated area can be clearly marked so that individuals who do not wish to have their faces identified can avoid it. Facial recognition at stadiums – Experience from Existing Deployments Facial recognition technology is deemed high-risk due to significant privacy concerns. However, in countries where face tickets are fully deployed—such as the Brazil, and Mexico—it is implemented with individual consent in controlled environments. Stadiums offer a controlled setting where consent is easily obtained, and biometric data can be securely managed. Ticket holders retain constant control over their data and can request its deletion after the event. This approach has shown positive outcomes, including reduced hate crimes, the apprehension of wanted individuals (e.g., the Palmeiras case), increased match day revenue for clubs, and the elimination of bottlenecks. Facial recognition technology currently stands as the most effective solution to stadium security challenges . There is no less intrusive alternative that provides the same level of safety and convenience. Beyond security benefits, facial recognition enhances stadium experiences by preventing ticket fraud, curbing abusive ticket reselling , ensuring fair pricing, expediting entry, and enabling secure payments. The first clubs to adopt facial recognition at stadiums will win with their fan base. By embracing facial recognition, clubs can ensure a safer and more enjoyable experience for their fans while also reaping the financial and operational benefits that come with it.

    "Football is a unique product whose success heavily relies on a club's performance. Simply put, most clubs attract fans primarily during times of winning trophies and competing in European competitions. Of course, there are exceptions, especially among top-tier clubs with global fanbases, rather than just local fanbase. However, even a popular product doesn't always guarantee sold-out stadiums. Maximizing ticket sales and ancillary revenue presents a completely different challenge for football clubs, one that requires a data-driven approach. Our research with clubs in the 1st and 2nd divisions of the Belgian Pro League reveals that access to fan data is a priority for 76% of the clubs. Club Brugge provides a great example of how fan data can be leveraged to boost monetization. By tracking fan heat maps within the stadium, they analyzed common movement patterns and discovered that while fans were interested in purchasing more merchandise, the stores were either too far away or too crowded. In response, the club added two additional points of sale, leading to a 33.69% increase in matchday revenue over the 14 games following this adjustment. Every empty seat is a lost opportunity Let's start with the basics — perfect attendance is very rare. Fan data from the German Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2 reveals a significant number of no-shows at games. It's important to differentiate between season ticket owners, who skip about 10-12% of their games on average, and one-time visitors, who miss their games 5-7% of the time. A prime example of this issue is RB Leipzig, which reports 100% attendance, but there's a catch — they count tickets sold, not the actual number of people in the stadium. In reality, despite selling 32,000 season tickets for the 2023/24 season, on average, one in four season ticket holders doesn't attend , which amounts to around 7,600 absent fans. This situation prompted the club to require season ticket owners to attend at least 10 out of the 17 home games to retain their membership. You might think this isn't a big problem since the clubs have already been paid for those empty seats. And that's exactly how many of them view it. No-shows cause a negative domino effect: Issue: Fans not attending block tickets for buyers who assume the game is sold out Opportunity: Attract new visitors and increase ticket sales Issue: Fans who don't attend aren't spending money at the stadium — simple as that Opportunity: Higher merchandise and concessionary sales Issue: Empty stadiums create a dull atmosphere and don't look appealing on screens Opportunity: Better sponsorship and broadcasting deals In the digital age, relying on fans to keep coming back as they did in the past is short-sighted. To truly maximize revenue the potential of the product, it's essential to understand behavioral trends. And that brings us back to the importance of fan data. The Key is to Combine Demographics with Behavioral fan data We often see two common problems: either clubs lack the proper tools to collect fan data, or they have loads of fan data they gather without a clear strategy for how to use it effectively. Anyone who has bought a ticket knows how much information clubs require — it takes minutes to fill out, and many of us wonder what they'll do with it. We'd hope for personalized service, but more often than not, it's just to fill the CRM. Here's how clubs should be leveraging that data to improve fan experience and matchday revenue. 1. Look at Larger Trends First This might be straightforward, but many really don't even scratch the surface. You should ask yourself how my fans make decisions. What are the attendance numbers by opponents over the past seasons? Is attendance relative to the club's league position—or the position of the opponents? How do attendance numbers vary by kick-off month, day, and time? How does the weather affect attendance? Are certain competitions attracting more visitors? These patterns can help clubs predict attendance and adjust their communication and marketing strategies accordingly. For instance, clubs with a global fan base could focus their advertising on tourists during travel seasons and shift their attention to local audiences for other fixtures. The key is to identify which games a fan is most likely to skip. It also doesn't make sense to advertise games to season ticket holders. Instead, clubs could communicate the option to transfer or release their tickets if they can't attend. Additionally, clubs can anticipate inventory needs within stadiums. Many collaborate with external food and beverage providers who determine how many concessions will be open. This often leads to long lines and frustrated fans abandoning their purchases, resulting in lower sales during the match. We could go on with numerous examples, but let's focus on ticket sales and logistics as the key areas. 2. Understand Game Choices of Your Fans Every club should be capable of breaking down the decision-making process behind ticket purchases, as this reveals different fan segments, each requiring a tailored approach. What is the age and gender of the buyer? Where do they come from – local or foreign? Returning or first-time visitor? How many tickets do they purchase? What seating preferences do they have? What prices are they willing to pay? We've already discussed how geography can shape your marketing campaigns based on seasonality. But the rest of your fan data plays a significant role in upselling, cross-selling, or simply encouraging repeat purchases. Let's explore a few examples. If you know a buyer is attending with their family, it opens up opportunities to offer products geared toward children, who are often big influencers in purchasing decisions. This could range from merchandise and kids' meal options to special entertainment activities. First-time visitors are more likely to buy merchandise compared to regular fans who likely already own some. On the other hand, season ticket holders should be offered the chance to purchase the new season kit early on — if they've bought the last three versions, it's almost guaranteed revenue, right? If you know fans usually attend in larger groups — whether it's families, colleagues, or friends — you can tailor ticket and food bundles to match the group size. And one last one — if you know the buyer's preferred price range, you can offer them upgrades that are still within their budget. Or, you can make these offers around special occasions, like their birthday. 3. Laser Target Fan Preferences It's great to offer bundles, but wouldn't it be even better if you could almost predict what the fan wants and deliver it at just the right moment? This is especially crucial because fan monetization doesn't stop once they pass through the turnstile. This naturally leads to questions like: How early before the game does he arrive? What items does the fan repeatedly buy? What is his usual order size? What payment range is he willing to spend? Does he buy multiple times per game? This information allows clubs to offer personalized bundles — not just to the right groups, but with the right content. You can easily tailor offers to match buying trends. Why offer a €20 bundle to a customer who is willing to spend €50? That's a missed revenue opportunity. If you know a fan tends to make multiple purchases during a game, you might want to let them order from their seat and pick up their items once they receive a notification. On the other hand, if someone typically buys only once, perhaps sending them a discount notification could encourage that purchase and increase the total spending. Build Clear Customer Journey from Multiple Touch Points Using Fan Data The key is having all data sources connected to ensure no data is lost. Every club should be able to maintain a clean profile for each fan that includes demographics, geography, and purchase behavior trends. With such a profile, tracking the lifetime value of fans and rewarding their loyalty becomes easy. The real power lies in understanding patterns and tailoring product offerings in marketing communication to match the desires of each individual. The days of one-size-fits-all campaigns are over. Personally, I find it frustrating to receive standardized offers — like being asked to buy a season ticket when I already have one or to follow a club's social media account that I've been following for years. As a fan, if I provide my data to a club, I want it used to enhance my experience. If I put in the effort to fill out all the registration forms, the club should take the time to cater to my needs. Not only does this approach build loyalty, but it also increases fan monetization. Clubs can do advanced filtering — like identifying all fans who have attended at least five games, spent more than €75 on food and beverages, but haven't purchased any merchandise. With just a few clicks, you have a list of people who can receive a special campaign offering a discount on a shirt with their name on it. That's just a simple example, but you get the idea how to maximize fan satisfaction and matchday revenue simultaneously. Use Single Identifier for Every Single Point of Contact Last common issue is that many club platforms are supplied by different providers and don't communicate with each other. While implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) might seem like a straightforward solution, it doesn't fully address the problem. Having a complete customer journey doesn't necessarily ensure accurate fan data. For example, if fans share their tickets with others, the club no longer collects data about the real visitor. This skews all demographic, geographic, and purchase behavior data. Additionally, if a fan lends their season card, which may also be used for payments within the stadium, the profile can be further distorted by the spending behavior of the lender, rather than reflecting the actual card owner. Moreover, clubs typically only have information about the ticket buyer, not the rest of the attendees. Since buying multiple tickets is common in football, if a fan purchases eight tickets in their name, the club lacks details about the remaining seven people. This means the club cannot communicate with them, send offers, or personalize their experience, resulting in missed opportunities for fan engagement. The ideal identifier should be something universally owned and always with us — like our face. If every fan linked their face to their ticket , the club would know exactly who is entering and enjoying the game. By also linking payment cards to their faces within the club's platform, the club could analyze spending patterns and behaviors. If fans could only use a friend's season ticket card by attaching their face to it for that specific game, the club would accurately track individual behavior separate from the ticket holder's account. Using facial recognition isn't a trade-off but rather a mutual benefit for both the fan and the club . Fans share their data in exchange for better personalization and treatment from the club. This personalization should then reflect in higher matchday revenue. So no wonder every third club sees fan data as the most crucial value in the present and future.
