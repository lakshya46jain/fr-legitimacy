By combining strong \"relationship\" identities with our patented protocol, processes, and flows--- secure, continuously authenticated application channels can be established with blazing speed and at IoT scale. This powerful omnichannel technology enables a phenomenal user experience with every authorization and login while dramatically reducing your attack surface. Strong Authentication Made Simple Mutual, simultaneous, and continuous multi-factor authentication. All right within your own native app with the authenticator of your choice. Built for the mobile-first world to deliver a simple, consistent, and phenomenal user experience that increases engagement. Provide customers a consistent and phenomenal experience across all channels - online, mobile, IVR, call center, chat, kiosk, and in-person. Connect over a whitelist based secure communication tunnel that is MITM proof and more secure than TLS. Without any of the operational complexity or cost. Encrypt data stored locally on the device using a key that doesn't exist until a fully verified and trusted context is established. For security better than Trusted Execution Environments. Use military-grade root/jailbreak/malware detection at consumer speed to block connections from vulnerable or compromised devices. Our mobile SDK lets you add the right level of security to your mobile app, tuned to your needs and the risk profile. Customize a comprehensive set of policy controls based on device, user and other context variables that allow you to meet your unique business needs and risk parameters. The REL-ID platform is delivered as a client-side SDK (REL-IDSDK) coupled with a set of server components that fit into the organization's security infrastructure. The SDK can be embedded in the business' own applications and works on all the major operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows, OSX, and Linux) and interfaces . The SDK also allows you to plug in the biometric authenticators of your choice, making it possible to choose different biometrics as required. The SDK server components are horizontally scalable soft appliances that can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, and sit either at the edge of the network or close to the service being protected. Unlike many other security solutions on the market, Uniken never touches your connections — our edge-server appliance is entirely in your control. More information about the architecture and how the platform works can be found here . 2) THE REL-IDVERIFY APP The REL-ID verify App is a white labeled mobile app (available for the Android and iOS platforms) that incorporates all our capabilities in a ready-to-deploy app for organizations that do not have their own mobile app but want to add the security of fully authenticated transaction verification to their digital business. It is a way to quickly roll out identity and transaction verification to protect card-not-present, call center and web login interactions with your customers without incurring the time and resources needed to build your own app. The app is fully white labeled, allowing organizations to maintain their own brand experience. 3) THE REL-ID WFA With REL-ID Work from Anywhere (WFA), you can empower your employees, partners, and contractors to securely work from anywhere quickly and easily. Uniken offers a quick and simple deployment model to enable rapid adoption with minimal disruption. Employees, partners, and contractors can now securely access corporate resources from their homes with REL-ID WFA without the hassle and expense of complex VPNs. This easy-to-use desktop application provides the same level of security as being in the office for both corporate-issued and personal computers. Our customer success team can get you up and running in a matter of days with straight forward integration to your existing infrastructure and security products, policies, and controls.

As such, it is important for businesses to provide an easy and fast way for customers to access their accounts on their without compromising their security. This comprehensive guide addresses the three main challenges of omnichannel security (client experience, security/privacy, and cost/complexity) and outlines ways to navigate these concerns through a Unified Defense in Depth strategy. This multilayered approach to security: Provides a frictionless experience for the customer; Is more secure than traditional passwords and knowledge-based authentication (KBA) Is cheaper and easier than multifactor authentication methods; Provides the means for mutual & simultaneous authentication; and Delivers fast ROI for your Digital Transformation initiative Download the free guide today by filling out the form below to see how you can increase your business's security while offering secure, seamless, and easy-to-use access to your customers across any channel.",

    "Technology Vision Product Differentiators How it Works Defense in Depth FAQ Solutions Identity Verification Mobile Web Call Center Kiosk Work From Anywhere Solution Transaction Verification Work From Anywhere Solution Problems We Solve Poor Client Experience (CX) PII Exposure Credential Compromise Credential Harvesting Expanding Threat Surface TLS / SSL Vulnerabilities SDK Bloat Increasing Costs Poor Client Experience (CX) TLS / SSL Vulnerabilities News / Blog Blog Press Releases In the News Company Investors Management Contact There is a new story of credentials being phished on a targeted basis, or even en masse, seemingly on a daily basis. With the unfortunate tendency many people have of reusing credentials across multiple sites, it is virtually a guarantee that some number of the almost seven billion credentials that are already known to be compromised will be used to access your site and services. REL-ID slams the door shut on this risk and any exposure to credential compromise. No Credential to Compromise No Credential to Compromise By most reports there are anywhere from 5 billion to 7 billion credentials that have already been compromise that we know of . Coupled with common user behavior of reusing credentials across multiple services, there's an excellent chance that the password some of your customers are using for your site have been compromised elsewhere and are waiting to be tried on you. REL-ID's strong and passwordless authentication eliminates the need for credentials, and the attendant risk they pose for you and your services. You get strong authentication and no vulnerability to credentials compromise. Built-in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) REL-ID turns your customer's mobile device into the strongest, safest, and most convenient form of MFA possible. The heart of REL-ID's security model relies on the generation and distribution of unique keys that have a 1:1 relationship between the user/app/device and your service at Internet scale. This key, unkown to the user, represents a massive enhancement to the traditional multi-factor authentication model of Something You Know + Something You Have. The key represents a third and much stronger factor: Something You Have But Don't Know. Because the user doesn't know what their key is, it cannot be maliciously obtained using Credential Harvesting or any of the other common types of Credential Compromise . Every third-party that plays a role in your security represents a point of disintermediation and a point of vulnerability in your architecture. Certificate Authorities (CAs) can be compromised and DNS can be poisoned, allowing someone else to spoof your services. Your CDN or VAN is explicitly allowed to be a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) for your TLS connections, so a bad actor there can inspect every transaction to your site. REL-ID eliminates the need for many third-parties, such as CAs, in your environment. DNS poisoning becomes irrelevant since your app won't connect to a fake site. CDNs and VANs will not be able to peer into the secure channel that REL-ID establishes between you and your client. Bottom Line: REL-ID eliminates the security exposure from any necessary third-parties (e.g. DNS providers) and outright eliminates the need for many others (e.g. CAs). With REL-ID, you can leverage your mobile app and the strong authentication we add to it as a global authenticator across every one of your channels. Doesn't matter which channel the user comes through, they can authenticate themselves with a simple approval done on a device you trust. Eliminate passwords and 3rd party authenticators, stop using PII, make interactions faster and more consistent, provide your customers the assurance that they are safe, and increase customer satisfaction.
