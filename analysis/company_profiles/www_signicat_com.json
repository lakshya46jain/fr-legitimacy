    "Webinar Get ready for the AI Act The AI Act will introduce new regulations that will impact how businesses use artificial intelligence. Watch the recording of the webinar with Bent Dalager , Partner and Head of Innovation & NewTech at KPMG, and Pinar Alpay , Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Signicat. Discover what the AI Act means for your company and gain expert insights into AI-driven identity fraud. Watch the recording Fraud attempts have surged by 80% in the past three years, with AI-driven fraud emerging as a significant threat. Its complexity is evolving, leaving financial service providers and fintechs struggling to defend themselves. Fraudsters are using AI to create sophisticated schemes that are increasingly difficult to detect and prevent. Deepfakes now represent 6.5% of total fraud attempts, marking a staggering 2137% increase over the past three years. The challenge for the industry is no longer just about AI making fraud more effective; it's now about AI driving fraud on an industrial scale. This study explores various aspects of fraud and AI-driven identity fraud, including the current state of fraud, awareness of AI's role in fraud, the prevalence and impact of AI-driven identity fraud, the rise of deepfakes, organisational readiness to combat AI-driven fraud, and future prevention strategies. The first study on AI-driven identity fraud Learn the insights of fraud decision-makers from financial institutions across Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Get the full report – The power of AI is undeniable. Within little more than a year it has transformed how we think about the digital economy – accelerating us towards a future with unthinkable levels of automation. AI will bring substantial efficiency gains into all parts of the economy. However, it will also present new threats as bad actors learn how to use the technology for their criminal purposes.

Get all the key findings The Battle to Onboard report tells us that more mature digital identity schemes can lead to consumers being more demanding , and less likely to tolerate a bad experience. See all key findings in Battle to Onboard Get more insights Blog Why are users continuously abandoning onboarding to financial services year upon year? Blog Does onboarding to financial services match up to users' digital maturity? Webinar Why financial service providers are losing 68% of their online applicants Blog Financial service onboarding: a six-year retrospective Onboarding gone wrong The pandemic has forced people online, yet digital services have turned out to be inadequate and failing to give customers what they need. 68% of consumers have completely abandoned an onboarding application in the last year . This is up from 63% from 2020. And it's only getting worse. This is especially the case with Gen Z. Younger people (18-44 years) tend to have a higher likelihood to abandon the application process entirely if it doesn't work the way they expected. This abandonment goes down with age, but Gen Z, in particular, is not willing to wait around for a lengthy onboarding process, especially among those from Western, Northern, and Southern Europe. Get the report Digital maturity vs. expectations People in countries with a trusted digital identity scheme and previous positive interactions increases expectations for future interactions. While people in countries where digital identity is newer, have lower expectations when it comes to onboarding. Despite widespread use of eIDs, abandonment is the highest in the Nordics . The more widespread the adoption of digital identity schemes becomes, the more expectations increase. And when faced with a bad onboarding experience, more than half of all customers are less inclined to use that company in the future. See the report Identity beyond borders Countries across Europe are working on or have already implemented digital identity systems. But there are preferences for how people prove their identity. 55% had had a good experience with scanning physical identity documents , while people are happy to use mobile cameras and webcams to scan physical media like passports. Near Field Communication (NFC) was not as popular , with only 29% having had a good experience. Just half of the respondents had a good experience of recording a video to prove who they were . With the increasing number of video calls in the last two years, people are sick and tired of even more video. But digital identity in the form of an eID scheme is almost universally popular. For financial service providers, offering the eID schemes that those consumers want to pass into new markets is critical to attracting customers across those markets.

Over half agree that reducing fraud is an acceptable reason for a more complex financial application. But 92% of people are concerned about the amount of data they share with the bank when completing an application. This has led to 21% abandoning the application because they had to provide too much personal information. These are fundamental problems with data privacy, which can only be countered with education.

But 42% of respondents were unable to access essential financial services as they were either inaccessible, or unavailable digitally. Universal digital access to financial services is not in place just yet. The markets with the least difficulty in meeting their customers' needs, Sweden and Norway, are both leaders and pioneers in digital identity.
