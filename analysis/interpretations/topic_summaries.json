      "Introduction: The Death of the Password In the not-so-distant past, accessing workplace systems meant juggling passwords, pin codes, keycards, and security questions. For employees, it was a routine frustration. For enterprises, it was a vulnerable patchwork of outdated authentication systems. By 2030, this experience will be as obsolete as dial-up internet. Welcome to the Post-Password Office —a seamless, biometric-powered, AI-enhanced workplace where your identity becomes the gateway to everything. At the heart of this transformation is Physical Identity and Access Management (PIAM) , a convergence of physical security, digital credentials, and smart automation. With Soloinsight's CloudGate PIAM platform , organizations are not just securing their facilities—they're designing intelligent access ecosystems that recognize, adapt, and respond to people in real-time. From Fragmented Credentials to Unified Identity The workplace of yesterday was defined by fragmentation. Different buildings, departments, and systems all had their own keys—badges for entry, passwords for computers, separate systems for visitor access, and manual approvals for contractors. CloudGate PIAM tears down these silos. It enables: Unified identity governance across physical and digital realms Cross-system synchronization , from HR platforms to building controls Single-source-of-truth credentials , housed securely in mobile wallets or biometric templates In the Post-Password Office, your face , phone , and contextual access level replace dozens of disparate tokens. Whether you're entering the facility, logging into a workstation, or accessing a restricted lab, your identity travels with you—intelligently and invisibly. AI and Behavior-Driven Access Control Smart identity isn't just about knowing who someone is—it's about understanding what they should be doing . CloudGate's integration of artificial intelligence and behavior analytics turns passive authentication into predictive access management . Here's how it works: Pattern recognition : AI learns daily routines—who enters which zones, when, and how. Dynamic policy enforcement : Access privileges adjust in real-time based on risk scores. Anomaly detection : Deviations from behavioral norms—like an executive badge accessing a server room at 3 AM—trigger alerts. Threat mitigation : Suspicious behavior triggers automated escalations and temporary lockdowns. In essence, the Post-Password Office becomes proactive , not reactive. Security is no longer static—it evolves with the people it protects. TRA Face ID: The Face of the Future Facial recognition lies at the core of the identity revolution. But not all facial recognition is created equal. Soloinsight's TRA Face ID is built on three principles: Touchless – Fast, hygienic, and pandemic-proof Reliable – 3D liveness detection prevents spoofing Accurate – Precision-matched with role-based policies TRA Face ID powers: Secure entry at turnstiles and gates Contractor compliance checks against watchlists and expired credentials Visitor recognition with pre-approved mobile passes In 2030, your face is your badge. No plastic cards. No forgotten logins. Just walk in—and the system takes care of the rest. Goodbye Passwords, Hello Presence-Based Authentication While digital authentication has evolved with two-factor methods, most physical access controls are still stuck in the early 2000s. Legacy systems rely on: Easily cloned RFID cards Manually provisioned badges Insecure clipboard-based visitor logs CloudGate PIAM modernizes this experience by introducing presence-based access control , where a person's physical presence, combined with contextual signals, unlocks their world. Consider this: An engineer approaches a secure lab Their mobile wallet credential pings the system Face ID verifies identity AI confirms they're on shift and in good standing Access is granted—without a single manual step This frictionless flow isn't just more secure—it's dramatically more efficient. Contractors and Visitors: Secured, Streamlined, and Smart Temporary personnel are often the biggest blind spots in access control. Contractors come and go. Visitors get lost in the shuffle. Traditional processes create compliance risks and operational headaches. CloudGate solves this with: Pre-arrival vetting and ID verification Mobile credential issuance that auto-expires Integration with e-signature platforms for NDAs and safety protocols Time- and zone-limited access permissions In the Post-Password Office, even temporary guests get a seamless, secure experience—without burdening front desk staff or IT teams. Compliance is the New Normal Whether it's HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, or SOC 2, modern workplaces are navigating an increasingly complex web of compliance mandates. CloudGate PIAM eases the load by: Auto-logging every access event , tied to verified credentials Providing on-demand reports for audits Enforcing access separation by role, project, or classification level Embedding consent workflows for biometric data capture and storage In 2030, compliance isn't a separate system. It's baked into the access architecture from day one. Case Study: A Fortune 100's Passwordless Transformation One of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies recently partnered with Soloinsight to transform access across their R&D campuses. Prior to implementation: Employees needed separate credentials for each building and system Contractors were manually processed, often taking days Password resets cost the IT department over $500,000 annually Post-CloudGate deployment: Face ID replaced all internal password logins and badge entries Mobile onboarding reduced contractor lead time from 72 hours to 15 minutes PIAM analytics detected an insider threat attempt in real time Visitor satisfaction scores jumped by 45% This wasn't just a security upgrade. It was a cultural one—an embrace of the future. From Hybrid Work to Global Mobility The future of work is not just passwordless—it's borderless . Employees now split their time between corporate HQs, satellite offices, home environments, and travel hubs. CloudGate PIAM enables: Identity portability across locations and devices Geo-fencing rules for access from certain IPs or countries Remote identity verification for hybrid hires Global revocation of credentials across all access points This mobility-first approach is crucial to enterprise resilience and talent acquisition in 2030 and beyond. Decentralized Identity and Self-Sovereign Control In a post-password world, identity moves beyond central databases. CloudGate supports decentralized identity models powered by blockchain, giving individuals: Ownership of their credentials Control over what data is shared and when The ability to prove access rights without revealing unnecessary details This shift is pivotal in high-privacy sectors like healthcare, legal services, and R&D. PIAM as a Driver of Productivity Security often competes with convenience. But the Post-Password Office proves they can coexist—and even enhance each other. With CloudGate: Employees gain back hours otherwise lost to help desk tickets and re-authentication Facility managers can track occupancy and zone usage in real time Executives receive predictive risk assessments with suggested remediations HR departments can sync terminations and new hires automatically across systems What used to be a security gate becomes a productivity engine . The Roadmap to Going Passwordless Ready to start the journey? Here's how enterprises can transition: Assess your existing access landscape —identify gaps and redundancies Deploy CloudGate in a pilot facility , focusing on a high-traffic or high-security area Roll out biometric onboarding , beginning with opt-in programs Train your workforce on privacy, security, and new credential workflows Scale across departments and geographies , integrating with HR, IT, and legal tools Soloinsight's deployment team guides this transformation every step of the way. Final Thoughts: Trust, Transformed By 2030, we won't —we'll simply show up. We won't carry badges—we'll carry ourselves. And we won't fear forgetting passwords—because identity will be ambient, intelligent, and intuitive. The Post-Password Office is not science fiction. It's being built now—with CloudGate PIAM leading the charge. In this world, security is not a barrier. It's a bridge. A bridge to trust. A bridge to agility. A bridge to the future.

Schedule a personalized demo and discover how the future of workplace security starts with you—your face, your phone, your identity. Schedule a Demo Introduction: The Death of the Password In the not-so-distant past, accessing workplace systems meant juggling passwords, pin codes, keycards, and security questions. For employees, it was a routine frustration. For enterprises, it was a vulnerable patchwork of outdated authentication systems. By 2030, this experience will be as obsolete as dial-up internet. Welcome to the Post-Password Office —a seamless, biometric-powered, AI-enhanced workplace where your identity becomes the gateway to everything. At the heart of this transformation is Physical Identity and Access Management (PIAM) , a convergence of physical security, digital credentials, and smart automation. With Soloinsight's CloudGate PIAM platform , organizations are not just securing their facilities—they're designing intelligent access ecosystems that recognize, adapt, and respond to people in real-time. From Fragmented Credentials to Unified Identity The workplace of yesterday was defined by fragmentation. Different buildings, departments, and systems all had their own keys—badges for entry, passwords for computers, separate systems for visitor access, and manual approvals for contractors. CloudGate PIAM tears down these silos. It enables: Unified identity governance across physical and digital realms Cross-system synchronization , from HR platforms to building controls Single-source-of-truth credentials , housed securely in mobile wallets or biometric templates In the Post-Password Office, your face , phone , and contextual access level replace dozens of disparate tokens. Whether you're entering the facility, logging into a workstation, or accessing a restricted lab, your identity travels with you—intelligently and invisibly. AI and Behavior-Driven Access Control Smart identity isn't just about knowing who someone is—it's about understanding what they should be doing . CloudGate's integration of artificial intelligence and behavior analytics turns passive authentication into predictive access management . Here's how it works: Pattern recognition : AI learns daily routines—who enters which zones, when, and how. Dynamic policy enforcement : Access privileges adjust in real-time based on risk scores. Anomaly detection : Deviations from behavioral norms—like an executive badge accessing a server room at 3 AM—trigger alerts. Threat mitigation : Suspicious behavior triggers automated escalations and temporary lockdowns. In essence, the Post-Password Office becomes proactive , not reactive. Security is no longer static—it evolves with the people it protects. TRA Face ID: The Face of the Future Facial recognition lies at the core of the identity revolution. But not all facial recognition is created equal. Soloinsight's TRA Face ID is built on three principles: Touchless – Fast, hygienic, and pandemic-proof Reliable – 3D liveness detection prevents spoofing Accurate – Precision-matched with role-based policies TRA Face ID powers: Secure entry at turnstiles and gates Contractor compliance checks against watchlists and expired credentials Visitor recognition with pre-approved mobile passes In 2030, your face is your badge. No plastic cards. No forgotten logins. Just walk in—and the system takes care of the rest. Goodbye Passwords, Hello Presence-Based Authentication While digital authentication has evolved with two-factor methods, most physical access controls are still stuck in the early 2000s. Legacy systems rely on: Easily cloned RFID cards Manually provisioned badges Insecure clipboard-based visitor logs CloudGate PIAM modernizes this experience by introducing presence-based access control , where a person's physical presence, combined with contextual signals, unlocks their world. Consider this: An engineer approaches a secure lab Their mobile wallet credential pings the system Face ID verifies identity AI confirms they're on shift and in good standing Access is granted—without a single manual step This frictionless flow isn't just more secure—it's dramatically more efficient. Contractors and Visitors: Secured, Streamlined, and Smart Temporary personnel are often the biggest blind spots in access control. Contractors come and go. Visitors get lost in the shuffle. Traditional processes create compliance risks and operational headaches. CloudGate solves this with: Pre-arrival vetting and ID verification Mobile credential issuance that auto-expires Integration with e-signature platforms for NDAs and safety protocols Time- and zone-limited access permissions In the Post-Password Office, even temporary guests get a seamless, secure experience—without burdening front desk staff or IT teams. Compliance is the New Normal Whether it's HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, or SOC 2, modern workplaces are navigating an increasingly complex web of compliance mandates. CloudGate PIAM eases the load by: Auto-logging every access event , tied to verified credentials Providing on-demand reports for audits Enforcing access separation by role, project, or classification level Embedding consent workflows for biometric data capture and storage In 2030, compliance isn't a separate system.

      "Introduction: A Paradigm Shift in Enterprise Security Security is no longer just about keeping intruders out; it is about ensuring that the right people have access to the right places at the right time while maintaining a seamless and frictionless experience. The traditional methods of security—physical badges, access control systems, and manual credentialing—are outdated, inefficient, and vulnerable to security breaches. As enterprises grow in complexity, vemanaging identities, permissions, and access across multiple locations, remote teams, and third-party vendors becomes a monumental challenge. Legacy access control solutions cannot keep up with the demand for real-time identity verification, automated access provisioning, and AI-driven security insights. This is where Physical Identity and Access Management (PIAM) is changing the game. PIAM is not just an upgrade; it is a fundamental shift in how organizations manage security. By automating identity verification, centralizing access control, and integrating with both physical and digital security systems, PIAM is transforming the security landscape for enterprises across all industries. This blog explores how PIAM is revolutionizing enterprise security, why businesses are rapidly adopting it, and how solutions like Soloinsight's CloudGate are leading this transformation. The Security Challenges That Traditional Systems Cannot Solve Most security breaches occur due to poor identity management and access control failures. Organizations that rely on outdated security infrastructure face the following challenges: 1. Manual and Error-Prone Access Control Legacy access control systems require manual provisioning and deprovisioning of access rights, creating security gaps. Employees, contractors, and vendors often have access to areas they no longer need due to delayed or forgotten revocations. For instance, when an employee leaves a company, their physical badge should be immediately deactivated. However, in traditional systems, this process is often delayed or entirely overlooked, allowing unauthorized individuals to retain access to secure areas. 2. Siloed Security Systems Most enterprises operate multiple, disconnected security systems that do not communicate with each other. Physical security, IT security, visitor management , and identity governance often exist in separate platforms, leading to inefficiencies and compliance risks. Without a unified security platform, organizations struggle to enforce consistent access policies, making them vulnerable to security breaches and regulatory penalties. 3. Compliance and Regulatory Challenges Regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure require businesses to enforce strict identity verification and access control measures. Compliance failures can result in hefty fines, reputational damage, and legal consequences. Traditional systems rely on manual audits and record-keeping, making compliance reporting time-consuming and prone to human error. Without an automated compliance solution, businesses struggle to prove adherence to SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations. 4. Lack of Real-Time Threat Detection Most legacy access control systems operate on a reactive model, meaning security teams only identify breaches after they have occurred. Without AI-driven analytics and real-time monitoring, organizations remain blind to suspicious activities, unauthorized access attempts, and internal security threats. PIAM solves these challenges by introducing automation, intelligence, and seamless integration into security operations. How PIAM is Revolutionizing the Security Landscape Physical Identity and Access Management (PIAM) provides a centralized, automated, and intelligence-driven approach to managing security. It integrates identity verification, real-time monitoring, and AI-powered security enforcement into a single, scalable platform. 1. Automated Identity and Access Management PIAM eliminates manual access provisioning by using policy-based automation to grant or revoke access instantly. Employees and contractors are automatically assigned access permissions based on their role, department, and security clearance. Real-time access revocation ensures that when someone leaves the organization, their access is revoked immediately across all locations. Visitor and third-party access is strictly controlled, with temporary credentials that automatically expire after a set period. With CloudGate PIAM, enterprises can enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege policies, significantly reducing security risks and administrative overhead. 2. Unified Security: Breaking Down Silos A key advantage of PIAM is its ability to bridge the gap between physical and digital security. By integrating with enterprise IT systems, HR platforms, access control hardware, and cybersecurity frameworks, PIAM ensures that security policies are consistent across the organization. Active Directory and HR integrations ensure that identity verification is synchronized across all security layers. Biometric authentication adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that only the right individuals can access sensitive locations. Visitor management integration streamlines guest access without compromising security. This unified approach enables organizations to manage security from a single pane of glass, improving visibility and eliminating security blind spots. 3. AI-Powered Security and Real-Time Risk Analysis PIAM platforms leverage AI and machine learning to provide predictive security intelligence and proactive threat detection. AI algorithms analyze access patterns and detect anomalies, such as an employee accessing a restricted area outside of their normal work hours. Security teams receive instant alerts when unauthorized access attempts occur. Predictive analytics help prevent security breaches before they happen. A global banking institution that implemented CloudGate PIAM reduced unauthorized access attempts by 60 percent within the first year by utilizing AI-driven access controls. 4. Regulatory Compliance Made Simple PIAM simplifies compliance by automating access control enforcement and audit reporting. Real-time compliance dashboards provide instant visibility into access logs and security policies. Audit trails are automatically generated, eliminating the need for manual data collection. Organizations can enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust security to meet regulatory mandates. A Fortune 100 healthcare provider using PIAM reported a 50 percent reduction in audit preparation time, allowing security teams to focus on higher-value security initiatives. 5. Scalable Security for Growing Enterprises Organizations with multiple locations, hybrid workforces, and complex access policies need a security solution that can scale effortlessly. PIAM provides: Cloud-based access management, allowing enterprises to manage security from anywhere in the world. Mobile access credentials , replacing traditional badges with secure, smartphone-based authentication. Seamless scalability, ensuring new employees, contractors, and facilities can be onboarded without manual interventions. A leading technology company that switched to CloudGate PIAM saved over $500,000 annually in lost badge replacements and security inefficiencies. The Future of Security: Why PIAM is the Inevitable Evolution Enterprise security is no longer just about restricting access; it is about enabling seamless, identity-driven security that adapts to modern challenges. PIAM represents the next generation of enterprise security, providing: AI-powered identity verification for real-time threat detection. Cloud-based security infrastructure that scales with business growth. Integrated compliance automation, reducing legal risks and security liabilities. Organizations that continue to rely on outdated access control models will struggle to keep up with evolving security demands. Those that implement PIAM will not only improve security but also gain operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and a future-ready security framework.

Contact Us Introduction: A Paradigm Shift in Enterprise Security Security is no longer just about keeping intruders out; it is about ensuring that the right people have access to the right places at the right time while maintaining a seamless and frictionless experience. The traditional methods of security—physical badges, access control systems, and manual credentialing—are outdated, inefficient, and vulnerable to security breaches. As enterprises grow in complexity, vemanaging identities, permissions, and access across multiple locations, remote teams, and third-party vendors becomes a monumental challenge. Legacy access control solutions cannot keep up with the demand for real-time identity verification, automated access provisioning, and AI-driven security insights. This is where Physical Identity and Access Management (PIAM) is changing the game. PIAM is not just an upgrade; it is a fundamental shift in how organizations manage security. By automating identity verification, centralizing access control, and integrating with both physical and digital security systems, PIAM is transforming the security landscape for enterprises across all industries. This blog explores how PIAM is revolutionizing enterprise security, why businesses are rapidly adopting it, and how solutions like Soloinsight's CloudGate are leading this transformation. The Security Challenges That Traditional Systems Cannot Solve Most security breaches occur due to poor identity management and access control failures. Organizations that rely on outdated security infrastructure face the following challenges: 1. Manual and Error-Prone Access Control Legacy access control systems require manual provisioning and deprovisioning of access rights, creating security gaps. Employees, contractors, and vendors often have access to areas they no longer need due to delayed or forgotten revocations. For instance, when an employee leaves a company, their physical badge should be immediately deactivated. However, in traditional systems, this process is often delayed or entirely overlooked, allowing unauthorized individuals to retain access to secure areas. 2. Siloed Security Systems Most enterprises operate multiple, disconnected security systems that do not communicate with each other. Physical security, IT security, visitor management , and identity governance often exist in separate platforms, leading to inefficiencies and compliance risks. Without a unified security platform, organizations struggle to enforce consistent access policies, making them vulnerable to security breaches and regulatory penalties. 3. Compliance and Regulatory Challenges Regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure require businesses to enforce strict identity verification and access control measures. Compliance failures can result in hefty fines, reputational damage, and legal consequences. Traditional systems rely on manual audits and record-keeping, making compliance reporting time-consuming and prone to human error. Without an automated compliance solution, businesses struggle to prove adherence to SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations. 4. Lack of Real-Time Threat Detection Most legacy access control systems operate on a reactive model, meaning security teams only identify breaches after they have occurred. Without AI-driven analytics and real-time monitoring, organizations remain blind to suspicious activities, unauthorized access attempts, and internal security threats. PIAM solves these challenges by introducing automation, intelligence, and seamless integration into security operations. How PIAM is Revolutionizing the Security Landscape Physical Identity and Access Management (PIAM) provides a centralized, automated, and intelligence-driven approach to managing security. It integrates identity verification, real-time monitoring, and AI-powered security enforcement into a single, scalable platform. 1. Automated Identity and Access Management PIAM eliminates manual access provisioning by using policy-based automation to grant or revoke access instantly. Employees and contractors are automatically assigned access permissions based on their role, department, and security clearance. Real-time access revocation ensures that when someone leaves the organization, their access is revoked immediately across all locations. Visitor and third-party access is strictly controlled, with temporary credentials that automatically expire after a set period. With CloudGate PIAM, enterprises can enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege policies, significantly reducing security risks and administrative overhead. 2. Unified Security: Breaking Down Silos A key advantage of PIAM is its ability to bridge the gap between physical and digital security. By integrating with enterprise IT systems, HR platforms, access control hardware, and cybersecurity frameworks, PIAM ensures that security policies are consistent across the organization. Active Directory and HR integrations ensure that identity verification is synchronized across all security layers. Biometric authentication adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that only the right individuals can access sensitive locations. Visitor management integration streamlines guest access without compromising security. This unified approach enables organizations to manage security from a single pane of glass, improving visibility and eliminating security blind spots. 3. AI-Powered Security and Real-Time Risk Analysis PIAM platforms leverage AI and machine learning to provide predictive security intelligence and proactive threat detection. AI algorithms analyze access patterns and detect anomalies, such as an employee accessing a restricted area outside of their normal work hours. Security teams receive instant alerts when unauthorized access attempts occur. Predictive analytics help prevent security breaches before they happen. A global banking institution that implemented CloudGate PIAM reduced unauthorized access attempts by 60 percent within the first year by utilizing AI-driven access controls. 4. Regulatory Compliance Made Simple PIAM simplifies compliance by automating access control enforcement and audit reporting. Real-time compliance dashboards provide instant visibility into access logs and security policies. Audit trails are automatically generated, eliminating the need for manual data collection. Organizations can enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust security to meet regulatory mandates. A Fortune 100 healthcare provider using PIAM reported a 50 percent reduction in audit preparation time, allowing security teams to focus on higher-value security initiatives. 5. Scalable Security for Growing Enterprises Organizations with multiple locations, hybrid workforces, and complex access policies need a security solution that can scale effortlessly. PIAM provides: Cloud-based access management, allowing enterprises to manage security from anywhere in the world. Mobile access credentials , replacing traditional badges with secure, smartphone-based authentication. Seamless scalability, ensuring new employees, contractors, and facilities can be onboarded without manual interventions. A leading technology company that switched to CloudGate PIAM saved over $500,000 annually in lost badge replacements and security inefficiencies. The Future of Security: Why PIAM is the Inevitable Evolution Enterprise security is no longer just about restricting access; it is about enabling seamless, identity-driven security that adapts to modern challenges. PIAM represents the next generation of enterprise security, providing: AI-powered identity verification for real-time threat detection. Cloud-based security infrastructure that scales with business growth. Integrated compliance automation, reducing legal risks and security liabilities. Organizations that continue to rely on outdated access control models will struggle to keep up with evolving security demands. Those that implement PIAM will not only improve security but also gain operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and a future-ready security framework.

We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Professional Training Year (PTY) Semester 1 & 2 Core This module supports students' development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement. It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment. The PTY module is concerned with Personal and Professional Development towards holistic academic and non-academic learning, and is a process that involves self-reflection, documented via the creation of a personal record, planning and monitoring progress towards the achievement of personal objectives. Development and learning may occur before and during the placement, and this is reflected in the assessment model as a progressive process. However, the graded assessment takes place primarily towards the end of the placement. Additionally, the module aims to enable students to evidence and evaluate their placement experiences and transfer that learning to other situations through written and presentation skills.

See the department Our BSc Politics and Sociology offers a range of compulsory and optional modules to enable students to gain a comprehensive grounding in the two disciplines at the same time as tailoring their studies to their specific interests. The academic year is divided into two semesters of 15 weeks each. Each semester consists of a period of teaching, revision/directed learning and assessment. The structure of our programmes follow clear educational aims that are tailored to each programme.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Politics and International Relations This course is taught by academic staff from Politics and International Relations, part of the School of Social Sciences. Our BSc Politics and Sociology offers a range of compulsory and optional modules to enable students to gain a comprehensive grounding in the two disciplines at the same time as tailoring their studies to their specific interests. The academic year is divided into two semesters of 15 weeks each. Each semester consists of a period of teaching, revision/directed learning and assessment. The structure of our programmes follow clear educational aims that are tailored to each programme. These are all outlined in the programme specifications which include further details such as the learning outcomes.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence.

View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

BSc (Hons) with placement BSc (Hons) with foundation year BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement Year 1 - BSc (Hons) This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. Optional modules for Year 3 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Professional Training Year (PTY) Semester 1 & 2 This module supports students' development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement. It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment. The PTY module is concerned with Personal and Professional Development towards holistic academic and non-academic learning, and is a process that involves self-reflection, documented via the creation of a personal record, planning and monitoring progress towards the achievement of personal objectives. Development and learning may occur before and during the placement, and this is reflected in the assessment model as a progressive process. However, the graded assessment takes place primarily towards the end of the placement. Additionally, the module aims to enable students to evidence and evaluate their placement experiences and transfer that learning to other situations through written and presentation skills.

Optional modules for Professional Training Year (PTY) - Students select one of POLP025, POLP026, POLP0276 depending on the type of PTY year they are engaging in. BSc (Hons) with foundation year The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. Semester 1 & 2 The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students must complete a total of 120 credits. All modules are optional. In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

Professional Training Year (PTY) Semester 1 & 2 Core This module supports students' development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement. It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment. The PTY module is concerned with Personal and Professional Development towards holistic academic and non-academic learning, and is a process that involves self-reflection, documented via the creation of a personal record, planning and monitoring progress towards the achievement of personal objectives. Development and learning may occur before and during the placement, and this is reflected in the assessment model as a progressive process. However, the graded assessment takes place primarily towards the end of the placement. Additionally, the module aims to enable students to evidence and evaluate their placement experiences and transfer that learning to other situations through written and presentation skills.

We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students must complete a total of 120 credits. All modules are optional. In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

BSc (Hons) with placement BSc (Hons) with foundation year BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement Year 1 - BSc (Hons) This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Semester 1 & 2 The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study. Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students must complete a total of 120 credits. All modules are optional. In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. Optional modules for Year 1 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies.

There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Semester 1 & 2 The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study. Optional modules for Year 3 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 6 Students must complete a total of 120 credits. All modules are optional. In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Professional Training Year (PTY) Semester 1 & 2 This module supports students' development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement. It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment. The PTY module is concerned with Personal and Professional Development towards holistic academic and non-academic learning, and is a process that involves self-reflection, documented via the creation of a personal record, planning and monitoring progress towards the achievement of personal objectives. Development and learning may occur before and during the placement, and this is reflected in the assessment model as a progressive process. However, the graded assessment takes place primarily towards the end of the placement. Additionally, the module aims to enable students to evidence and evaluate their placement experiences and transfer that learning to other situations through written and presentation skills.

BSc (Hons) with foundation year The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. Semester 1 & 2 The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

Dr Nicholas Kitchen Programme leader More information Politics and International Relations This course is taught by academic staff from Politics and International Relations, part of the School of Social Sciences. See the department Our BSc Politics and Sociology offers a range of compulsory and optional modules to enable students to gain a comprehensive grounding in the two disciplines at the same time as tailoring their studies to their specific interests. The academic year is divided into two semesters of 15 weeks each. Each semester consists of a period of teaching, revision/directed learning and assessment. The structure of our programmes follow clear educational aims that are tailored to each programme. These are all outlined in the programme specifications which include further details such as the learning outcomes.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences. View full module details Optional modules for Foundation - FHEQ Level 3 For further information on FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6 please view the programme specification for the full-time BSc (Hons) Politics and Sociology programme. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence.

View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

We get to know our students on an individual level, providing ongoing feedback inside and outside of the classroom to enable them to achieve their potential. Group work Independent study Lectures Research work Seminars Tutorials Assessment We use a wide range of authentic assessments, in addition to more traditional academic essays and exams. Students learn to write for decision-makers through strategy reviews and policy papers, provide precise and concise analysis in the form of diplomatic notes, and communicate ideas effectively in documentary film scripts. General course information Contact hours Contact hours can vary across our modules. Full details of the contact hours for each module are available from the University of Surrey's module catalogue . See the modules section for more information. Timetable New students will receive their personalised timetable in Welcome Week. In later semesters, two weeks before the start of semester. Scheduled teaching can take place on any day of the week (Monday – Friday), with part-time classes normally scheduled on one or two days. Wednesday afternoons tend to be for sports and cultural activities. View our code of practice for the scheduling of teaching and assessment (PDF) for more information. Location This course is based at Stag Hill campus. Stag Hill is the University's main campus and where the majority of our courses are taught. We offer careers information, advice and guidance to all students whilst studying with us, which is extended to our alumni for three years after leaving the University. What can you do with a degree in politics and sociology? The short answer is – almost anything! The skills developed on our courses are highly transferable. This means that regardless of what career you choose to embark on, doorways will be opened with your excellent range of highly sought core skills including critical thinking, analytical writing, research methods and an excellent capacity for communication across platforms and audiences. Even if you are very unsure about what you want to do with your career, these foundational skills are an asset that will give you a platform for developing your professional profile across the private, public and third sectors. Research from Prospects (PDF) reveals that of the social sciences, students who study politics are the second most commonly found in high level professional jobs (75%). The research also showed a much higher propensity of students in these areas agree that the work they carried out was meaningful. So, with a politics and sociology degree, you can do almost anything but there is a good chance that whatever it is, you'll find yourself doing work that truly matters.

Dr Nicholas Kitchen Programme leader More information Politics and International Relations This course is taught by academic staff from Politics and International Relations, part of the School of Social Sciences. See the department Our BSc Politics and Sociology offers a range of compulsory and optional modules to enable students to gain a comprehensive grounding in the two disciplines at the same time as tailoring their studies to their specific interests. The academic year is divided into two semesters of 15 weeks each. Each semester consists of a period of teaching, revision/directed learning and assessment. The structure of our programmes follow clear educational aims that are tailored to each programme. These are all outlined in the programme specifications which include further details such as the learning outcomes.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Politics and International Relations This course is taught by academic staff from Politics and International Relations, part of the School of Social Sciences. Our BSc Politics and Sociology offers a range of compulsory and optional modules to enable students to gain a comprehensive grounding in the two disciplines at the same time as tailoring their studies to their specific interests. The academic year is divided into two semesters of 15 weeks each. Each semester consists of a period of teaching, revision/directed learning and assessment. The structure of our programmes follow clear educational aims that are tailored to each programme. These are all outlined in the programme specifications which include further details such as the learning outcomes.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences. View full module details Optional modules for Foundation - FHEQ Level 3 For further information on FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6 please view the programme specification for the full-time BSc (Hons) Politics and Sociology programme. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences. View full module details Optional modules for Foundation - FHEQ Level 3 For further information on FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6 please view the programme specification for the full-time BSc (Hons) Politics and Sociology programme. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence.

View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

BSc (Hons) with foundation year BSc (Hons) with placement BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement Year 1 - BSc (Hons) This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. Semester 1 & 2 The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences. Optional modules for Foundation - FHEQ Level 3 For further information on FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6 please view the programme specification for the full-time BSc (Hons) Politics and Sociology programme. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. Optional modules for Year 3 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Professional Training Year (PTY) Semester 1 & 2 This module supports students' development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement. It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment. The PTY module is concerned with Personal and Professional Development towards holistic academic and non-academic learning, and is a process that involves self-reflection, documented via the creation of a personal record, planning and monitoring progress towards the achievement of personal objectives. Development and learning may occur before and during the placement, and this is reflected in the assessment model as a progressive process. However, the graded assessment takes place primarily towards the end of the placement. Additionally, the module aims to enable students to evidence and evaluate their placement experiences and transfer that learning to other situations through written and presentation skills.

BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. Semester 1 & 2 The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

      "DOCSCAN REST API Reference API Endpoint Access URL Description Supported Documents & Countries HTTP Methods HTTP Parameters HTTP Response Code Samples Frequently Asked Questions Related PixLab API Endpoints API Endpoint Access URL https://api.pixlab.io/docscan Get Your API Key & Try DOCSCAN Now ↗ Description The DOCSCAN API endpoint scan, process and extracts information from virtually all officially issued ID documents including Passports, ID Cards, Driving Licenses, Visas, Birth & Death Certificates from nearly all recognized UN countries ↗ . As of this release, over 11,094 ID documents with or without MRZ from more than 200 countries and territories are fully supported . No other ID Scan platform has achieved such a milestone. All data scanning and extraction on the PixLab ID Scan Platform is performed entirely in-memory (RAM). No persistent storage is used, and no logs are retained . Once an identity document image is scanned, it is immediately purged from the processing server , ensuring full compliance with data minimization and privacy standards. In addition to ID document scanning capabilities , DOCSCAN features an automatic face detection and extraction tool. This feature crops faces from scanned documents and converts binary information such as ID Cards raw images or Passport Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) into JSON-formatted text ready to be consumed by your application . The resulting JSON data includes essential details like full name, issuing country, document number, address, expiry date, etc. prepared for seamless application integration. For practical application, see examples of JSON outputs for processed Passport images or ID card images at the example section below . Input Passport Specimen (JPEG/PNG/BMP Image) Extracted ID Holder Information (with automatic face cropping) DOCSCAN is the sole REST API endpoint located at https://api.pixlab.io/docscan needed to perform ID scanning with automatic face cropping. As of this release, over 11,094 ID documents with or without MRZ from more than 200 countries and territories are fully supported. PixLab recommend linking your AWS S3 bucket via the PxLab Console ↗ to ensure that all cropped images and extracted data are directly stored in your bucket, providing complete control over your users data. Explore various code samples below , with additional examples available on the PixLab Github Repository ↗ . For handling PDF documents, first convert them to raw images using the PDFTOIMG ↗ API Endpoint, and send the returned image link directly to the DOCSCAN API endpoint using a simple GET HTTP Request . When you explicitly require face extraction in addition to text extraction capabilities, you must provide your own AWS S3 access credentials from the PixLab Console ↗ . This ensures that any cropped face image is uploaded and stored directly in your private S3 bucket, maintaining full control and ownership of your data . Developers are encouraged to refer to the code samples section and frequently asked questions section to about integrating DOCSCAN on their existing code bases. Supported Documents & Countries DOCSCAN supports a comprehensive range of officially issued ID documents, including but not limited to: Passports, ID Cards ( Citizen ID, Resident Card, Immigration ID, etc. ), Driving Licenses, Visas, Birth & Death Certificates from nearly all UN-recognized countries . With this release, the API can handle over 11,094 ID documents, with or without Machine Readable Zones (MRZ), from more than 200 countries & territories .

This ensures the scan engine stores all cropped faces in your private S3 bucket, maintaining data storage compliance. . faceblob | face-blob Boolean If this parameter is set to true , return the BASE64 encoding of the cropped PNG image of the extracted face instead of an S3 URL in the face_url object return field. POST Request Body Guidelines ( for using POST over GET ) Allowed Content-Types: multipart/form-data - Rely on this content type for local, direct image uploads . Refer to this Python script ↗ for a reference implementation. application/json - Use this content type when your input image is already hosted and accessible via URL. Example Showcase : The screen capture below illustrates a typical local image upload using a multipart/form-data POST request made via Postman : Code samples demonstrating how to perform a POST upload request in your preferred programming language can be found in the section below , or on the PixLab Github Repository ↗ . HTTP RESPONSE application/json : The DOCSCAN API endpoints always return a JSON object for each request, regardless of whether it was executed successfully. The table below lists the fields returned in a typical HTTP response : Field Type Description status Integer HTTP status code where 200 indicates success. Any other code indicates an error. type String Type of the scanned document. face_url URL Defaults to false unless you connect your AWS S3 bucket via the PixLab Console ↗ . This stores the URL of the cropped face image from the scanned document on your own AWS S3 Bucket . PixLab require storing extracted images directly in your own AWS S3 Bucket by linking it through the PixLab Console ↗ to maintain complete control over user data. If the optional face-crop field is set to false on the request, no face cropping operation will be done. If the optional face-png-blob field is set to true on the request, the BASE64-encoded PNG image of the cropped face is returned instead of the S3 URL . mrz_raw_text String Extracted raw MRZ text from the document (applicable for Passports and Visas only). fields Object Depending on the type of the document being scanned ( Passport, Driver License, ID Card, etc. ), a JSON Object with the following fields is always returned: fullName : The full name of the ID holder as scanned from the uploaded ID document. issuingCountry : The country or organization that issued the document. documentNumber : The unique number assigned to the document by the issuing authority. address : The address of the ID holder as listed on the ID, if available. dateOfBirth : The birth date of the ID holder, typically in YYYY-MM-DD format. dateOfExpiry : The expiration date of the document, typically in YYYY-MM-DD format. sex : The gender of the ID holder (if available), usually represented as 'M' for male, 'F' for female, or 'O' for other. nationality : The nationality of the ID holder, often coded in full country name or ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 format. issuingDate : The date the document was issued, typically in YYYY-MM-DD format. checkDigit : A checksum digit available on Passport document only calculated from other data within the document to verify its authenticity. personalNumber : An optional unique number assigned to the holder by the issuing authority. finalCheckDigit : An optional final checksum digit calculated from all the data on the document to ensure its integrity. issuingState : The state or region that issued the document, if applicable. issuingStateCode : A code representing the state or region that issued the document, if applicable. religion : The religion of the ID holder, if it is included on the document. error String Error message, present if the status field is different from 200 .

Python PHP JavaScript Ruby Frequently Asked Questions DOCSCAN is a secure, SDK-free REST API that allows developers to extract structured data from identity documents such as passports, national ID cards, and driver's licenses. It uses PixLab's Vision Language Models and supports TLS 1.3 for secure and high-accuracy processing. DOCSCAN supports over 11,000 document types from 197+ countries and regions, including passports, driver's licenses, visas, residence permits, and national ID cards. Both MRZ and non-MRZ formats, as well as multi-language inputs, are supported. View the full list of supported documents for details. Yes. All document images are processed entirely in-memory (RAM) and permanently deleted immediately after processing. No data is stored or logged on PixLab's servers. If you need to store extracted face crops, you can configure your own private AWS S3 bucket. DOCSCAN typically returns results in 2 to 5 seconds, depending on the image size, network latency, and document type. The system is optimized for real-time, high-volume applications. You can test DOCSCAN by signing up for a free trial on the PixLab Console ↗ to generate your API key and start integrating immediately. DOCSCAN accepts both GET and POST HTTP methods. You can upload an image via POST or provide an image URL using GET. All responses are returned in structured JSON format. See the HTTP response section for details. Yes. DOCSCAN can be deployed on a private server instance hosted in France or Germany for customers with strict infrastructure or jurisdictional requirements. Contact PixLab Support for more details. Yes. DOCSCAN supports ID documents written in multiple languages and scripts, including Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, and simplified/traditional Chinese. This makes it ideal for global onboarding and multilingual ID extraction. DOCSCAN automatically corrects image orientation, rotation, and basic visual enhancements , so you can upload images without needing to adjust their orientation or resolution. For optimal data extraction, provide clear PNG, JPEG, or BMP images, such as those captured by smartphones or webcams. All API calls are automatically made via HTTPS.

      "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS Round 9 Feature Match: Jason Holloway vs. Ryan Spicer Both players in this Feature Match have 7-1 records. They are experienced players determined to make it to Day 2 of the tournament. Ryan Spicer is hoping his Chaos Deck will get him there and Holloway is trying to make it there with Twilight. Jason Holloway won the die roll and chose to begin the first Duel. Holloway played \"Solar Recharge,†discarding \"Wulf, Lightsworn Beast†and sending \"Chaos Sorcerer\" and \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress\" to the Graveyard. He activated a second \"Solar Recharge†next, discarding \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress\" and sending a Wulf and \"Plaguespreader Zombie\" to the Graveyard. Wulf was Special Summoned to the field by its own effect. Then he activated \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" to send \"Torrential Tribute,†\"Heavy Storm,†and \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" to the Graveyard before searching his Deck for \"Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior.\" He Summoned \"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner,†discarded Garoth, and returned Garoth to play with Lumina's effect. Then he Set 2 cards to his back row and ended his turn. In the End Phase, he sent 2 copies of \"Judgment Dragon\" and a \"Necro Gardna\" to the Graveyard, among other cards. Spicer drew \"Destiny Draw,†\"Card Trooper,†\"Royal Oppression,†\"Dark Armed Dragon,†and \"Mind Control†in his opening hand. Holloway activated \"Trap Dustshoot†during Spicer's Draw Phase! Spicer revealed his opening hand along with the \"D.D. Crow†he had picked up for the turn, and Holloway sent \"Card Trooper†back to the Deck. Spicer Set \"Royal Oppression†to his back row and ended his turn. Holloway attacked with all of his monsters and dropped Spicer down to 3050 Life Points. He then activated the effect of Lumina by discarding \"Necro Gardna†to Special Summon a Wulf from his Graveyard, but Spicer chained \"D.D. Crow†to remove the Wulf from play instead. In Holloway's End Phase, he sent to the Graveyard 5 more cards. Spicer drew a card then Set one more back row next turn before ending his turn. One turn later, Holloway put a card from his hand on top of his Deck to revive \"Plaguespreader Zombie†and Ryan Spicer conceded. An amazing opening hand give Holloway total domination in game 1! Spicer chose to go first in Game 2. He opened up with \"Brain Control,†\"Torrential Tribute,†Kycoo, \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror,†\"Trap Dustshoot,†and \"Destiny Draw.†He Set Dustshoot and Torrential and ended his turn. Holloway drew a card and Spicer immediately activated \"Trap Dustshootâ€! He revealed \"Legendary Jujitsu Master,†\"Honest,†\"Solar Recharge,†\"Bottomless Trap Hole,†\"Malevolent Catastrophe,†and \"Necro Gardna\" from his hand. \"Legendary Jujitsu Master\" was returned to his Deck by the effect of \"Trap Dustshoot.†Holloway Set one monster face-down along with a face-down back row before ending his turn. Spicer drew another Kycoo and ended his turn without playing any cards. Holloway did the same on his next turn. Spicer drew \"Destiny Hero – Diamond Dude†next turn, and used it to draw 2 cards by activating \"Destiny Draw.†Then he used the \"Destiny Draw\" and \"Destiny Hero – Malicious†he picked up to draw 2 more cards. Unfortunately, he drew his second copy of Malicious, so he couldn't remove the one in his Graveyard from play. Spicer then Set a \"Card Trooper†face-down and ended his turn. Holloway activated \"Solar Recharge†next turn, discarding \"Celestia, Lightsworn Angel,†and sending Garoth and \"Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid†to the Graveyard. He Flip Summoned \"Honest†next, returned it to his hand with its own effect, and then Set one more card face-down in his back row. He then Set a monster and ended. Spicer drew \"Mystic Tomato†next turn. He Flip Summoned Card Trooper, sent 2 cards to the Graveyard to boost Card Trooper to 1400 ATK, and attacked into a face-down \"Honest.†He lost 500 Life Points. Holloway drew a card next turn, Set 2 cards to his back row, and activated a face-down \"Beckoning Light.†He discarded \"Necro Gardna,†\"Honest,†and \"Malevolent Catastrophe,†to return Garoth, Aurkus, and Celestia to his hand. He bounced \"Honest†back to his hand again and then Summoned Aurkus to the field. Aurkus attacked \"Card Trooper†and Spicer lost 800 Life Points and drew \"Royal Oppression†from Trooper's effect. Holloway sent 2 cards to his Graveyard in his End Phase with the effect of Aurkus and Spicer was up again. He drew a \"Mystic Tomato†on his turn. Spicer was at 6700 and Holloway was at 8000. Spicer Set his Tomato and ended his turn. Holloway switched Aurkus into defense mode next turn and Set one monster face-down. During Holloway's End Phase, Spicer flipped \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror\" so Aurkus wouldn't be able to send cards to the Graveyard. Spicer drew a card next turn, flipped \"Mystic Tomato,†and then activated his Set \"Torrential Tribute\" to clear the field. Holloway's Aurkus and face-down Lyla were destroyed, along with Spicer's Tomato. Spicer followed up by Summoning \"Breaker the Magical Warrior\" but lost it to \"Bottomless Trap Hole.\" Then he Summoned \"Dark Armed Dragon\" and removed a Tomato from play to destroy Holloway's Set D-Prison. Holloway activated \"Bottomless Trap Hole\" to get \"Dark Armed Dragon\" off of the field. Spicer ended his turn without setting the \"Royal Oppression\" he had in his hand. On Holloway's next turn, he Summoned Garoth and Set a \"Trap Dustshoot.†Garoth attacked Spicer and brought him down to 4850. Trap Dustshoot revealed \"Sangan,†\"Destiny Hero – Malicious, \"Brain Control,†2 Kycoos, and a \"Royal Oppression.†\"Sangan†was returned to Spicer's Deck. Spicer activated \"Brain Control\" and Holloway chained \"Necro Gardna.†Spicer Tributed Garoth for a face-down Malicious, Set Oppression, and ended his turn. Holloway activated \"Gold Sarcophagus\" next turn with only 2 cards left in his hand. He searched for \"Heavy Storm\" and removed it from play. He Set one monster and ended his turn without Setting a back row card. Spicer drew Breaker. He Summoned Kycoo to the field and attacked Holloway's face-down monster with Kycoo. He hit an \"Honest†and lost 100 Life Points, ending his turn. Holloway drew a card and Set a monster before ending his turn too. Spicer drew \"D.D. Crow†next turn. It wouldn't help him get rid of Holloway's \"Honest.†Kycoo attacked Holloway's face-down \"Legendary Jujitsu Master\" with Kycoo, and Kycoo returned to the top of his Deck. He ended his turn afterwards. Holloway drew a card and then took his removed from game \"Heavy Storm†that he searched for with \"Gold Sarcophagus.†He activated it to destroy Spicer's face-up \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror\" and Set \"Royal Oppression.†Then he activated \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" and sent \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†\"Card Trooper,†and \"Beckoning Light†to the Graveyard. Holloway searched for Garoth with the effect of Charge. He tried to Special Summon Plague from his Graveyard by putting a card on top of his Deck, but was stopped by Spicer's \"D.D. Crow†that removed Holloway's \"Plaguespreader Zombie\" from play. Holloway Summoned Garoth instead, and used \"Honest†to attack Spicer's face-down Malicious. Then Garoth attacked directly and dropped Spicer down to 2100 Life Points. Holloway returned \"Honest†to his hand in his 2 nd Main Phase and ended his turn. Spicer drew his Kycoo again next turn and realized he couldn't win. He conceded the Duel. Spicer's inability to draw a card that get over \"Honest's†1900 DEF costs him the game and gives Jason Holloway a 2-0 victory in the Match! Post-Event Analysis! See what our panel of experts had to say about this Duel after the event was over. Michael Kohanim (2009 World Championship Competitor) This was a rough Match for Ryan Spicer. I don't think there were any plays he could have made to change the outcome of the Match. Sometimes a player just doesn't draw well enough to stay competitive in a game. When it happens, it's important to just shake off the loss and move on. Matt Peddle (2009 Canadian National Championship Runner-Up; Five-Time Top 8 National Finalist) When Spicer flipped \"Trap Dustshoot†and sent \"Legendary Jujitsu Master†back to Holloway's deck instead of \"Necro Gardna,†he passed on an opportunity to destroy extra cards with \"Torrential Tribute.†Jujitsu Master would have to sit in Defense Mode and Spicer simply wouldn't Summon a monster to attack it. When Holloway does draw another monster he'll lose both to the Torrential while Spicer will lose nothing. Instead the Duel drags on longer and Spicer has to use his \"Torrential Tribute†on his own turn, which is much less effective. Not only that, but Holloway puts the Gardna to good use with \"Beckoning Light†as well. to check out the next Feature Match.",
      "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS Round 7 Feature Match: Steffon Bizzel vs. Paul Squires Both Duelists in this Feature Match have perfect 6-0 records and a great shot at making Day 2. Steffon Bizzell is running a Zombie Deck, and Paul Squires is using Blackwings. This should be a great Match. Bizzell won the die roll and chose to go first. His opening hand consisted of \"Allure of Darkness,†\"Dark Armed Dragon,†\"Bottomless Trap Hole,†\"Armageddon Knight,†and \"Morphing Jar.†He drew \"Destiny Hero – Malicious†as his first draw. He Summoned \"Armageddon Knight†for his opening play and dumped \"Necro Gardna†to his Graveyard with its effect. He Set \"Bottomless Trap Hole†and ended his turn. Squires Summoned Bora on his first turn, and lost it to Bizzell's \"Bottomless Trap Hole.†Squires then Set 1 card and ended his turn. Bizzell top Decked \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind†and activated \"Allure of Darkness.†He drew \"Goblin Zombie†and \"Mystical Space Typhoon.†He removed Malicious from play with \"Allure of Darkness's†effect. Next, Bizzell Normal Summoned \"Goblin Zombie†and attacked with both of his monsters. \"Goblin Zombie†sent \"D.D. Crow†from the top of the Deck to Squire's Graveyard. Squires had 5500 Life Points left. Bizzell Set \"Mysical Space Typhoon†and ended his turn. On his next turn, Squires Summoned \"Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame†and declared an attack on \"Armageddon Knight.†The attack was successful! Bizzell lost 400 Life Points and Shura recruited \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor†from his Deck. In his second Main Phase, Squires Synchro Summoned \"Magical Android†by Tuning Vayu with Shura and Set one more card to his back row. During Squires's End Phase, Bizzell flipped \"Mystical Space Typhoon†to destroy the \"Book of Moon†Squires just Set. On Bizzell's turn he drew \"Mezuki.†He Summoned \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind†and used its effect to halve the ATK of \"Magical Android.†Gale attacked Android and \"Goblin Zombie†attacked directly. Shura was sent to the Graveyard from the top of Squires' Deck and Squires dropped to 4900 Life Points. Bizzell ended his turn. Squires drew for his turn and then Summoned \"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North.†He targeted Shura with its effect. He had 3 cards in his hand, 1 card in his back row, and 2 monsters on his field. Bizzell had 3 cards in his hand with a \"Goblin Zombie†and Gale on the field. Squire declared a Synchro Summon by Tuning Blizzard with Shura and Synchro Summoned \"Blackwing Armed Wing.†He attacked Gale, but the attack was blocked by \"Necro Gardna.†On Bizzell's next turn he drew a \"Book of Life.†First, he used Gale's effect to halve \"Blackwing Armed Wing's†ATK. Then he Tuned Gale to \"Goblin Zombie†to Summon \"Black Rose Dragon†and activated its effect. Squires's Armed Wing and a Set Icarus Attack were destroyed. Bizzell searched his Deck for \"Zombie Master†with the effect of \"Goblin Zombie,†then Summoned it along with \"Dark Armed Dragon.†Squires scooped up his cards, knowing he wouldn't survive the turn. Both players Side Decked and Squires chose to begin Duel 2. He activated 2 copies of \"Black Whirlwind†and Summoned \"Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow.†He searched his deck for \"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North†and \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind†with his two copies of Whirlwind. Then, he Set \"Icarus Attack†and ended his turn. Bizzell opened up with \"Book of Life,†\"Dark Armed Dragon,†\"Soul Exchange,†\"Mezuki,†and \"Mystical Space Typhoon.†He drew \"Torrential Tribute†on his first turn. Bizzell thought for a little while and then activated \"Mystical Space Typhoon†on \"Icarus Attack.†He then Summoned Mezuki and attacked Kalut. Kalut was destroyed and Squires dropped to 7700 Life Points. Bizzell Set 2 cards and ended his turn. On Squires's next turn, he Summoned Blizzard and targeted Kalut. He made Blizzard's effect Chain Link 1, and the effects of Black Whirlwind Chain Links 2 and 3. Bizzell flipped Torrential. \"Mezuki†and Blizzard were destroyed, then Kalut was special Summoned to the field. Squires Set one more card to his back row and ended his turn. On his next turn, Bizzell drew \"Bottomless Trap Hole.†He then flipped his face-down \"Book of Life†and Special Summoned \"Mezuki†from his Graveyard by removing Blizzard from his opponent's Graveyard. \"Mezuki†attacked and Kalut was destroyed. Squires Summoned another Kalut on his next turn, searching for Blizzard and Vayu with the effects of his two \"Black Whirlwinds.†He then Special Summoned Gale and halved the ATK of \"Mezuki.†Kalut attacked \"Mezuki†and Gale attacked directly to drop Bizzell down to 6150 Life Points. It was a rough turn for Bizzell, who was stuck with a \"Bottomless Trap Hole†face-down against Squires's two low attackers. On his next turn, Bizzell drew Necro Gardna. He Set it and ended his turn. Play passed to Squires who activated a third \"Black Whirlwindâ€! He Tributed Kalut for \"Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn.†Bizzell flipped \"Bottomless Trap Hole†to remove Sirocco from play. Gale attacked \"Necro Gardna†and the attack bounced off of it. He halved Gardna's stats in Main Phase 2 by using Gale's effect. Squires ended his turn, Bizzell drew Burial, he Set it, and then he ended his turn too. On Squires' next turn, he used Gale to attack the \"Necro Gardna†with its stats halved, and destroyed it. He ended his turn. He had 3 \"Black Whirlwinds†but no Blackwings to Summon. Bizzell drew \"My Body as a Shield†next turn and ended his turn immediately. On Squires' next turn, he drew and Summoned \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer.†Kycoo and Gale attacked, dropping Bizzell to 3050 Life Points and removing all of his monsters from the Graveyard. Bizzell drew \"Brain Control†next turn. He already had \"Dark Armed Dragon,†\"My Body as a Shield,†and \"Soul Exchange,†in his hand. He activated \"Brain Control,†dropped to 2250 Life Points, and gained control of Squires' Gale. He then halved Kycoo's ATK and declared an ATK against him with Gale. Squires used \"Book of Moon†to flip Gale face-down and after Bizzell Set 1 more card in his back row, Squires got his Gale back. Squires used \"Allure of Darkness†next turn to draw 2 cards and remove a Vayu from play. Then he flipped his Gale back face-up and Synchro Summoned \"Blackwing Armor Master†by Tuning Gale with Kycoo. \"Blackwing Armor Master†tried to attack directly, but with \"Necro Gardna†off the field, Bizzell was able to activate \"Burial from a Different Dimension†to return \"Necro Gardna†to his Graveyard and block the attack. In Main Phase 2, Squires Summoned Shura and searched for 3 copies of Bora with his 3 copies of \"Black Whirlwindâ€! Bizzell drew a card and Set a \"Mystic Tomato†next turn. On Squires' turn, he attacked \"Mystic Tomato†with Bora, inflicting 600 damage to Bizzell's Life Points. Bizzell dropped down to 1650 Life Points. Squires searched his Deck for another \"Mystic Tomato†with the effect of his first one and Special Summoned it in Attack Position. Armor Master Attacked \"Mystic Tomato†and Squires dropped Kalut from his hand to seal the game and reduce Bizzell's Life Points to zero. Bizzell would be going first in Duel 3. Side Decking was fast and play began quickly. Bizzell had \"Necro Gardna,†\"Allure of Darkness,†\"Caius the Shadow Monarch,†\"Mystic Tomato,†and \"Trap Dustshoot†in his opening hand. He drew \"Dark Armed Dragon†on his first turn. He activated \"Allure of Darkness†to draw \"Soul Exchange†and \"Heavy Storm,†removing \"Necro Gardna†from play. He Set his Dustshoot along with a Tomato and ended his turn. On Squires's Draw Phase, Bizzell activated Dustshoot! Squires revealed his own Dustshoot, \"Solemn Judgment,†\"Book of Moon,†\"Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn,†\"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North,†and Kycoo. Bizzell chose to send Kycoo back to Squires' Deck. In Main Phase 1, Squires Summoned Sirocco and attacked Bizzell's \"Mystic Tomato.†Bizzell searched his Deck for \"Goblin Zombie†with Tomato's effect and Special Summoned it in attack mode. Squires Set 2 cards and ended his turn. During Bizzell's Draw Phase, he activated \"Trap Dustshootâ€! Squires revealed a \"Heavy Storm,†\"Soul Exchange,†\"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter,†\"Caius the Shadow Monarch,†and \"Dark Armed Dragon.†Caius was sent back to his Deck. Bizzell Set his \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter†face-down and ended his turn. \"Man, Heavy and DAD,†Squires said. He sounded a bit disappointed about his current lack of good plays. He thought for a while about his next play and eventually decided to Special Summon Bora to the field. Bora attacked a Defense Position \"Goblin Zombie†and inflicted 650 damage to Bizzell's Life Points. That was the first damage Bizzell had taken. Bizzell searched his Deck for \"Zombie Master†with \"Goblin Zombie's†effect. Squires attacked \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter†with Siocco next. Bizzell sent \"Necro Gardna,†Mezuki, and \"My Body as a Shield†to the Graveyard with Ryko's effect and destroyed Squires' face-down \"Book of Moon.†Squires acknowledged the three DARK monsters in his opponent's Graveyard, Set a back row card, and ended his turn. He knew what was coming but could do nothing to stop it. Bizzell drew another Soul Exchange next turn. Then he activated \"Heavy Storm†to destroy Squires's Set \"Solemn Judgment,†and then he Summoned \"Dark Armed Dragonâ€! \"Dark Armed Dragon†destroyed Sirocco by removing \"Mystic Tomato†from the game. Next, he Summoned \"Zombie Master†to the field. \"Dark Armed Dragon†attacked Bora and \"Zombie Master†attacked directly. Bizzell Set 2 cards and ended his turn. On his next turn, Squires Normal Summoned Blizzard and Special Summoned Bora from his Graveyard. He tuned his two monsters together for \"Goyo Guardian†and then declared an attack on \"Zombie Master.†Bizzell negated the attack with \"Necro Gardna.†In Main Phase 2, Squires removed Bizzell's \"Goblin Zombie†from the Graveyard with \"D.D. Crow.†On Bizzell's turn, he attacked \"Dark Armed Dragon†into Goyo, destroying them both, and attacked directly with \"Zombie Master.†Squires had no cards on the field or in his hand and activated \"Allure of Darkness.†He drew 2 cards, removed Shura from play and Set a \"Brain Control.†Bizzell activated \"Mystical Space Typhoon†to destroy it in the End Phase. On his next turn, Bizzell drew \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind.†He discarded it with \"Zombie Master†and Special Summoned \"Mezuki†from his Graveyard. With only 3300 Life Points left, Squires scooped up his cards. Some awesome plays made by Bizzell give him a 2-1 win with his Zombie Deck. He's now 7-0 in the tournament, advancing with a perfect record! Post-Event Analysis! See what our expert had to say about this Duel after the event was over. Michael Kohanim (2009 World Championship Competitor) This Match was extremely well-played by Bizzell. I was especially impressed with the way he played the second Duel. Squires started out with 2 copies of \"Black Whirlwind,†which made for a killer opening, but Bizzell managed to hold his own for most of the game. It was a great idea to Set the bluffs that he did throughout the Duel. They could have baited Spell and Trap destruction cards away from the Trap Cards like \"Bottomless Trap Hole†and \"Torrential Tribute†that he needed to protect as long as Squires had 2 copies of \"Black Whirlwind†on the field. to check out the next Feature Match.",
      "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS Top 16 Feature Match: Ivan Anamaria vs. Brian Hines Five Lightsworn Decks made it to the Top 16 here today, and this Feature Match is a Lightsworn vs. Lightsworn mirror match. Brian Hines is wielding some new tech from Stardust Overdrive : \"Shire, Lightsworn Spirit\" and \"Archlord Kristya.\" If Hines can get Kristya into play he may have a big advantage over Ivan Anamaria's Lightsworn. In theory, Kristya could give Hines the edge in reusing his \"Honests\" and could lock Anamaria out of his Special Summons. But with just 1 copy of Kristya in his Deck, would Hines even see the card in time to use it effectively? We were about to find out! The Duelists wished each other good luck, and Hines opened the match with 2 \"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoners,†\"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress,†\"Charge of the Light Brigade,†\"Judgment Dragon,†and \"Honest.\" He activated Charge, sending \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter,†\"Necro Gardna,†then a second \"Necro Gardna\" to the Graveyard! A huge start for Hines as he fetched \"Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior\" from his Deck. He Normal Summoned Lumina, discarded Garoth, Special Summoned it, and ended, sending \"Wulf, Lightsworn Beast,\" \"My Body As A Shield,†\"Shire, Lightsworn Spirit,†\"Monster Reincarnation,†and \"Beckoning Light\" to the Graveyard. No draw with Garoth but Hines got to Special Summon that Wulf. \"It's your move†stated Hines, seeming confident. Anamaria took a moment to read Shire's effect, then Set one Spell or Trap Card. He Summoned Lumina, activated \"Card Destruction,†and each Duelist got new hands: 3 cards for Anamaria and 4 for Hines. Anamaria activated \"Gold Sarcophagus,†removing \"Brain Control\" from his Deck to claim it in 2 turns. With \"Royal Decree,†\"Jain, Lightsworn Paladin,†and \"Honest\" in his Graveyard, Anamaria discarded \"Necro Gardna\" to Special Summon Jain, then eyed the field. He sent Jain to attack Lumina, and Hines removed one of his 2 \"Necro Gardnas\" to keep Lumina safe. Anamaria ended, sending \"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner,†\"Ehren, Lightsworn Monk,†\"Plaguespreader Zombie,†\"Necro Gardna,†and \"Monster Reincarnation\" to his Graveyard. Hines was up. He discarded his third \"Necro Gardna\" for Lumina's effect, bringing up Lyla. He activated her effect, destroyed Anamaria's bluffed \"Monster Reincarnation,†and entered his Battle Phase. Wulf attacked Lumina, and Anamaria repelled it with \"Necro Gardna.†Garoth attacked next, and Anamaria removed another Gardna. Lumina attacked Anamaria's Lumina and both monsters were destroyed. Hines Set two cards to his back row and ended. He sent \"Waboku,†\"Celestia, Lightsworn Angel,†\"Archlord Kristya,†\"Solar Recharge,†and \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" to his Graveyard. Again, no draw with Garoth. Anamaria activated \"Heavy Storm,†destroying Hines' \"My Body As A Shield\" and \"Mirror Force.†That left Anamaria with Jain on the field and one card in hand. Hines had Lyla in Defense Position, Garoth and Wulf in attack, and 2 cards in hand. Anamaria would get his \"Brain Control\" next turn, but it was unclear whether or not he'd survive that long. He sent Jain to attack Garoth and Hines blocked again with \"Necro Gardna.†In the End Phase Anamaria lost Lumina and \"Judgment Dragon\" to the Graveyard – bad news. That Dragon was one of Anamaria's few hopes in this Duel. Hines attacked Jain with Garoth next turn, destroying it. Wulf attacked for 2100 Battle Damage, and Hines Set a card to his Spell & Trap Card Zone. In the End Phase Hines sent \"Wulf, Lightsworn Beast\" to the Graveyard with Garoth's effect, Special Summoning it and scoring another free draw. Anamaria drew for his turn, then claimed his \"Brain Control\" from his 'removed zone.' He activated \"Solar Recharge,†discarding \"Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid\" to draw 2 cards and send Ryko and Garoth to the Graveyard. He activated \"Brain Control,†took control of Lyla, and turned her to Attack Position. He activated her effect and Hines Chained the target – \"Waboku\"! Anamaria Tributed Lyla for Celestia, targeted Hines two copies of Wulf, and sent \"Honest,†Lyla, \"Phoenix Wing Wind Blast,†and his second \"Judgment Dragon\" to the Graveyard. With no \"Necro Gardnas\" in his Graveyard and both \"Judgment Dragons\" gone, Anamaria was in a bad situation. He had one card left in hand that was unknown, and he ended his turn. Hines drew to 4 cards, activated \"Charge of the Light Brigade,†and sent \"Beckoning Light,†Aurkus, and \"Giant Trunade\" to the Graveyard to get Jain. Hines was running low on cards in his Deck though – he had just 5 cards left. He Normal Summoned \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†Tuned it to Garoth, and Synchro Summoned \"Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier.†He discarded \"Solar Recharge\" to bounce away Celestia, attacked for 2300 damage, and Anamaria was down to 2750 Life Points. Next turn Anamaria activated Charge, sent Ryko, \"Beckoning Light,†and another Charge to his Graveyard, and heaved a sigh – he really wanted to hit that last \"Necro Gardna,†and Charge hadn't helped. He took Aurkus from his deck, Summoned it, placed a card back on top of his Deck to Special Summon \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†and Synchro Summoned \"Ally of Justice Catastor\"! Catastor attacked Brionac, destroying it with its effect. Anamaria Set his last card to his back row and ended. Hines drew, and had \"Solar Recharge,†Jain, and \"Honest\" – Anamaria had a real shot at pulling this out, but Hines still had \"Plaguespreader Zombie\" in his Graveyard. He Set Jain, Set Recharge, and ended. Catastor destroyed Jain next turn and Hines passed, taking a direct shot from Catastor. Anamaria Set a monster. Hines drew Ehren and Normal Sumoned her. He attacked Anamaria's face-down \"Necro Gardna\" and Ehren kicked it back into the Deck. He placed \"Heavy Storm\" back on top of his Deck, Tuned it to Ehren, and Synchro Summoned \"Goyo Guardian.†Hines shook his head. Anamaria discarded Celestia for \"Solar Recharge,†drawing 2 cards and sending \"Honest\" and \"Necro Gardna\" to the Graveyard. Catastor attacked and Hines removed \"Necro Gardna.†Anamaria Set a second Spell or Trap Card. Hines activated \"Heavy Storm,†but Anamaria Chained \"Phoenix Wing Wind Blast\"! Wind Blast sent Goyo back to the Extra Deck, leaving Hines to Set \"Honest.†Anamaria Summoned Garoth, smacked into \"Honest,†then destroyed \"Honest\" with Catastor. Hines drew \"Torrential Tribute,†Set it, and ended with one card left in his Deck. Anamaria attacked with Garoth, then Catastor, leaving Hines at 1750 Life Points. Anamaria Set his last card, a monster. Hines summoned Lyla, flipped \"Torrential Tribute\" to clear the field as one last act of defiance, and ended his turn with no cards left. Anamaria passed and Hines lost when he couldn't draw. A huge opening and early game falls flat, as Brian Hines just can't finish the job and Decks out! Ivan Anamaria fights back in the mid and late game, coming back from a rough start to take the first Duel! Both competitors went straight for their Side Decks. Hines opened with \"Waboku,†\"Beckoning Light,†\"Burial From a Different Dimension,†\"Charge of the Light Brigade,†\"Celestia, Lightsworn Angel,†and \"Necro Gardna.†He activated Charge, sending \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress,†\"Heavy Storm,†and Kristya to the Graveyard – Beckoning would give him access to that Kristya later, but for now the Charge got him \"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner.†Hines might want to get that Celestia going as quickly as possible to start stacking his Graveyard with Fairies, and \"Necro Gardna\" would let him do that. He discarded Gardna, Special Summoning Lyla with Lumina's effect. He ended, sending \"Shire, Lightsworn Spirit,†\"Chaos Sorcerer,†\"My Body As A Shield,†\"Monster Reincarnation,†\"Honest,†and another \"Necro Gardna\" to the Graveyard. He now had 2 Fairies in addition to Kristya itself in the Graveyard. Anamaria discarded \"Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid\" for \"Solar Recharge,†drawing 2 and sending Recharge and Lyla to the Graveyard. \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" sent another Charge, Kycoo, and another Lyla to his Graveyard to get him Lumina. He Summoned her, discarded \"Phoenix Wing Wind Blast\" to Special Summon Lyla, and sent Lyla to attack Lumina. Hines removed \"Necro Gardna.†Anamaria was in trouble – Lyla could destroy any 1 card he Set to his back row, while Celestia would destroy his monsters. He Set one card to his Spell & Trap Card Zone, then sent Celestia, \"Monster Reincarnation,†\"Honest,†\"Monster Reincarnation,†\"Royal Decree,†and \"Plaguespreader Zombie\" to his Graveyard in the End Phase. Hines activated Lyla's effect, targeting \"Phoenix Wing Wind Blast.†Anamaria Chained it, discarding \"Bottomless Trap Hole\" to send Lumina back to the top of his opponent's Deck. Lyla was tributed for Celestia, sending Aurkus, \"Mirror Force,†Lumina, and Jain to the Graveyard, destroying Lumina and Lyla. Hines still didn't have his fourth Fairy. He Set two cards to his back row, attacked for 2300 Battle Damage, and ended. Anamaria Special Summoned \"Judgment Dragon\"! He activated its effect, but Hines Chained \"Beckoning Light\" and \"Burial From a Different Dimension\"! He discarded \"Waboku\" and \"Lightning Vortex,†taking back \"Archlord Kristya\" and Lumina. He then returned his \"Necro Gardna\" to the Graveyard, and Celestia was destroyed. He still had only 3 Fairies in his Graveyard though – he'd need to draw one and discard it for Lumina's effect to get Kristya onto the field – no easy task. Anamaria Normal Summoned \"Phantom of Chaos,†removed Lumina from his Graveyard to mimic her effect, then discarded another Phantom to Special Summon Aurkus in Defense Position. \"Judgment Dragon\" attacked for 3000 damage, Anamaria attacked for no damage with \"Phantom of Chaos,†and he moved to his End Phase. He then sent \"Honest,†\"Lightning Vortex,†\"Bottomless Trap Hole,†\"Solar Recharge,†\"Brain Control,†\"Necro Gardna,†another Aurkus, \"Chaos Sorcerer,†and \"Dark Armed Dragon\" to his Graveyard. Hines drew \"Plaguespreader Zombie.†He Normal Summoned Lumina, tried to discard \"Plaguespreader Zombie\" for her effect, but was reminded about Aurkus's effect. He attacked \"Phantom of Chaos,†was denied by \"Necro Gardna,†and sent 3 cards to the Graveyard in his End Phase – \"Judgment Dragon,†\"Honest,†and \"Necro Gardna.†He now had his fourth Fairy, but he needed to survive until next turn to get Kristya into action. The Duel stood at 4700 Life Points to Hines' 5000. Anamaria drew, holding 1 card in hand with Phantom, \"Judgment Dragon,†and Aurkus on the field. Anamaria activated Phantom's effect, removed \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer,†and Hines confirmed the resolution by mistake before trying to Chain his \"Necro Gardnas\". He was not permitted to do so as a result. Anamaria Summoned Garoth, attacked with everything, and the Duel was over! A forgotten Chaining opportunity ends the match, as Brian Hines simply forgets to make the moves that would have carried him to his next turn. Ivan Anamaria moves on to the Top 8! Post-Event Analysis! See what our panel of experts had to say about this Duel after the event was over. Michael Kohanim (2009 World Championship Competitor) Brian Hines chose to use \"Waboku†in his Deck over the more popular \"Threatening Roar,†and I think he made a good choice. Kalut and \"Honest†are popular cards on the tournament scene and \"Waboku†is a better card to use against them. If your opponent attacks your monster with a weaker one while planning to activate the effect of \"Honest†or Kalut, \"Waboku†will force your opponent to activate their ATK pump or lose the monster they attacked with. \"Threatening Roar,†on the other hand, would only prevent the attack from happening. Plus, \"Waboku†has the added benefit of keeping your monster on the field while your opponent's monster gets destroyed in a battle between two monsters with the same ATK. With Gladiator Beast Decks slowly fading away from the competitive tournament scene, we may begin to see \"Waboku†gain even more popularity in Top 16 Decks other than Hines's and Murray's. Matt Peddle (2009 Canadian National Championship Runner-Up; Five-Time Top 8 National Finalist) Hines was in total control of game one and he let it slip away because he was too afraid of \"Honest.†He brought out \"Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier†to return his opponent's \"Celestia, Lightsworn Angel†back to his hand, instead of taking it with \"Goyo Guardian.†This ended up costing him the game because he was unable to take care of \"Ally of Justice Catastor†without Brionac. Michael McTavish (Top 8 Finalist – 2009 Canadian National Championship) A huge misplay by Hines at the end cost him the Match. If he had Chained his \"Necro Gardna†when \"Phantom of Chaos\" copied Kycoo, in order to block an incoming attack, he could have lived one more turn and made a huge push with \"Archlord Kristya†in the upcoming turn. to check out the next Feature Match."

      "Q. What 3M transparency film is recommended for use with my machine? A. 3M has a variety of transparency products available for use in Ink Jet, Laser, Thermal Transfer printers, as well as copiers. The 3M help line can answer questions regarding which product is suitable for use in your particular printer (1-800-328-1371). Also see our compatibility guide . Q. Are there any special steps I need to take to produce a good image through my printer when using 3M transparency films? A. The first step you should take is to consult your printer manual for special instructions when printing on transparencies. Many times the printer driver has a special setting for printing on transparencies. Q. Must I only use the printer manufacturers transparency product when printing, will this void my warranty? A. Some manufacturers may imply this, but 3M guarantees its products to work in the recommended printers and stands firmly behind this guarantee. Q. Why won't my image dry? A. In most cases this is due to feeding the transparency incorrectly. This is easily done, and if you follow these rules, the issue will be resolved: 1. If the transparency is fed from the front of the machine, and exists in the front of the machine, place the transparency imaging side down (textured side), in the media tray. 2. If the transparency is fed from the rear, and exits to the front, place transparency textured side in Media tray facing up, toward the user. 3. If the transparency is fed from the rear, and exits to the rear, place the transparency in the feed tray textured side down, or away from the user. The only other likely reason for the image not to dry is that the incorrect product is being used for that particular printer. Q. Do I print on the textured or smooth side of the transparency? A. The image should always be applied to the textured side of the transparency. Loading instructions on the box will assist in the determination of how your printer feeds transparencies for imaging. Q. How long does the ink take to dry once I've imaged my transparency? A. Ink dry times can vary, and are dependent on the inks used with each printer. Some printers have heaters which assist in drying (consult your printer manual to find out the recommended process for transparency film printing, and if your printer has a heater). It is advised that you allow more time before placing the imaged transparency in a protective sleeve, or if imaging is done under high humidity conditions. Q. What is the difference between CG3460, CG3410, and CG3480? A. Each of these products was designed to perform well with different printers. Each printer manufacturer uses different inks for imaging through their printer. The transparencies have an ink receptive coating which is designed to perform well with these different inks. See the online compatibility guide for products recommended for use with your printer. Q. Can CG3460 be used with a Canon or Epson printer? If not, what will happen if it is? A. CG3460 is designed for best results with Hewlett Packard printers, and a few others. You can image CG3460 on other ink jet printers without damage to the printer, however, the image may not be as good as one with the recommended product for the printer being used. Q. Can I use plain paper copier or laser transparency film with my ink jet printer? A. No, these products are designed to accept images only from a toner based printer or copier. Ink jet transparencies are designed to accept the liquid ink for imaging through ink jet printers. Q. What is the cause of the image looking fuzzy, or the colors mixing together? A. This problem is called bleed . This is one of the major complaints on ink jet transparencies. Make sure you are using the transparency film recommended for your printer. 1. This happens when the inks placed on a coated transparency are unrestricted from spreading when applied. The inks tend to run together, thus giving a poor image, or flow into un-imaged areas giving a fuzzy appearance to the image. Ink jet films are designed to be compatible with certain inks allowing only so much of the ink to flow once it is applied to the surface. 2. Moisture can adversely affect the image quality of ink jet transparencies due to the fact that these films are designed to accept moisture. The inks used are composed of water and other components. The problems begin when moisture from the atmosphere is introduced into the coated surface of the imaged transparency product. This may happen in very humid areas of the world. The result of this is that the moisture combines with the ink and creates too much liquid for the coating on the film to hold, thus bleed may occur. To reduce this occurrence, always store the dry - imaged transparency in contact with a sheet of bond or copier paper. This paper will absorb any excess moisture. Q. What causes banding or clear lines running horizontally through my imaged transparency? A. This is due to the ink jet nozzles being clogged or a lack of flow of the inks in the image. First try cleaning the nozzles with a soft moist tissue, consulting the owner's manual may help. Also, make sure you are using the transparency film recommended for your printer. Q. Where can I purchase A4 size transparency film for my printer? A. A4 size product is normally not available within the US. We can assist in helping you find vendors who can supply you with A4 product, simply contact us at our Customer Care Center. Q. Can you write on a transparency with a transparency marker? A. Not all transparencies are designed for this purpose, however most will accept writing with a marker designed for use with transparencies. There are transparency films designed specifically for this purpose, 3M products AF4300, and AF4309 are such products. Q. Can CG3410 be used with an HP printer? If not, what will happen if it is? A. CG3410 is designed specifically for the printers recommended by 3M. You may try this product with an HP printer without damaging the printer, but the quality may not be as good as with the recommended product for that printer. Q. CG3480 is recommended for my Deskjet color printer, why can't I use CG3460? A. CG3480 is recommended for use when printing is mono - chrome only, it is not recommended for use with color for the Deskjet printers. CG3480 may be used as an alternate, but performance is at a lower level when compared to CG3460. Q. Does 3M sell extended format ink jet transparencies such as 11\" x 17\"? A. There are many divisions within 3M that offer imaging products, and extended formats are available for some applications. The 3M help line is the best source for assistance in finding answers for your needs (1-800-328-1371). Q. What is the difference between Highland and 3M film? A. The only real difference between the two products is that the specifications for manufacture of the products is slightly more relaxed with the Highland brand. It is also possible that there may be a slight defect which will not jeopardize performance with the Highland brand, nor will it be readily evident to the end user. The 3M branded product is manufactured and sold under strict specifications.

It adopts the latest UV hardening technology, which can directly print images on a variety of materials, such as metal, plastic, stone, ceramics and so on. UV printers have many characteristics that can be called advantages, such as high precision, fast speed, low cost, and wide application range. It is also one of the trends of digital printing in the future. What is UV Printer The UV printer is a high-end printing machine that uses UV-curable inks to create high-quality prints on various substrates. Unlike traditional inkjet or laser printers, the UV printer applies ink in a single pass, giving it a faster printing speed. The UV inks used are formulated to dry instantly upon exposure to UV light, which allows for a wide range of print applications, including printing on non-porous and rough surfaces. Features of UV Printer Superior Print Quality UV inks used in UV printers produce prints with remarkable color vibrancy and resolution, making them ideal for graphic designs, product packaging, and other commercial printing applications that demand high-end print quality. Fast Printing Speed The UV printing process involves a single pass application of ink, resulting in faster printing speeds compared to traditional inkjet or laser printers. This efficiency makes the UV printer well-suited for high-volume printing tasks.

      "\"What we enjoy here is just the whole idea of being able to take advantage of everything that's good about San Francisco, being right here in the middle of the city,\" beams Mario Sazo, Dean of Students at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory. \"You're close to the arts, you're close to the ballet, we've got all of these relationships that go on throughout the city.\" It's impossible to deny the magic of Sacred Heart's setting. Perched atop Cathedral Hill, the campus seems to have all of San Francisco under its purview—from awe-inspiring urban cityscapes out of every window, to the 5.6 acre Jefferson Square Park, which sprawls downhill and to the southwest. Founded in 1852, Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory is a diverse urban school with a rich history, and Mr. Sazo has been at its helm for over 16 years. As you might expect from someone with his impressive tenure, Sazo seems to possess a slightly superhuman amount of energy. Positive and quick-witted, his banter with students is self-assured, at times self-depricating, and always met with smiles and laughter from the kids. For as many negative interactions that I could possibly have in this job, I try to make it a point to make sure I have more positive interactions than anything else because… I think that kind of helps in a small way building the community that we have. Happy With PlascoTrac, Happier With Hero Sacred Heart was successful with PlascoTrac. By integrating their discipline system with PowerSchool through PlascoTrac, they built successful programs to check kids into school, track behaviors during the day, and save administrative time not having to manually input behavioral occurrences into their SIS. PlascoTrac helped Mario automate Sacred Heart's discipline programs, but it was tied to one room. Their mobile devices offered some mobility, but for only a few people. As a cloud based solution, Hero offered the potential to take their programs into the classroom, the hallways, and anywhere there is a staff member—while still talking to PowerSchool and doing all of the other things that made PlascoTrac successful at the school. I got a lot more backing when we went from PlascoTrac to Hero, because even the tech director was asking, \"When are they going to go to the cloud?\" With no updates to install, the ability to function from a browser in any computer in the school, and mobile apps for iOS and Android, an upgrade to Hero was much more than a design improvement and some catchy \"cloud app\" jargon—it allowed them to expand throughout the school. We're a big school, and we pride ourselves in being able to track where our kids are at every period. With 1,300 students and a deceptively large campus—in San Francisco, buildings expand skyward out of necessity—Hero gives Mario and his team the power to track behaviors where they happen. And anywhere he is, he can check up on a student in Hero. I always joke with the school president about that—between Hero and PowerSchool, I've got the whole school in my pocket. Free to Innvoate The day we visit Sacred Heart, they're having a blood drive . \"The blood drive used to be a big fiasco for us attendance-wise,\" Mario explains. Not anymore. No computer on a cart to wheel in. The secretary simply shows up with a laptop, checks kids in and out, prints out dress passes for the kids that donate blood, and gets them back off to class. \"It's all one-stop shopping at that point.\" The blood drive is a great way to get kids engaged for a good cause, and it illustrates the flexibility that Hero provides the team at Sacred Heart. With a system that can be anywhere, they can track any program, and reward (or assign consequences to) kids anywhere in the school. More staff are engaged, and more positive programs are possible than ever before. Another new program that Sacred Heart has been able to try with Hero was a wellness program . Knowing that he wanted a way to encourage students to take advantage of Sacred Heart's outstanding fitness center, Mario worked with Hero's support team to set up a program that keeps track of which students are using the fitness center, and for how long. Looking at the data for this school year, Mario boasts that there are only 5 students that haven't checked in to the fitness center . A New Way of Doing Things I tell everybody, we've got these capabilities, don't be afraid to bring your ideas to the table. The switch from PlascoTrac to Hero has been about more than mobility, and even adoption. These things are important, and Mario is excited to start getting Hero into the classroom for school-wide initiatives, but there's a shift more fundamental happening at Sacred Heart—one with the potential for tremendous impact. With Hero, Mario and his team have the freedom to be creative in how they design and deploy new programs like the blood drive and the wellness program whenever they want. In short, they have the opportunity think big. And that means more positive interactions with students, more opportunities to modify behavior—more time spent on things that matter.

      "Fifty or so miles east of downtown Los Angeles lies Santiago High School in Corona, California. In many ways, Santiago is like many suburban-area high schools. They serve a diverse student population, are proud of their 99.7% graduation rate, and offer a multitude of athletics and extracurricular programs. Something else one might expect – and will – find at Santiago High is an exceptionally dedicated group of teachers and staff. Included in this team is Assistant Principal Melissa Bako. Skills for Career & College-Ready Success At just like so many high schools, the Santiago staff is deeply committed to the success of their students. And they know that building career and college ready young adults doesn't begin and end with academics. It's also about teaching students to be responsible and competent citizens. Students need these soft skills, they feel, when entering the workforce or post-secondary education. How is Santiago High doing that? It all comes down to the learning environment. Building Up Students and School Climate To create a schoolwide culture of positivity, staff and teachers use Hero. Initially, the high school implemented Hero to improve student tardiness. When Bako came to Santiago in the fall of 2016, she expanded the tool (which they're using LCAP funding to support) and the school is using Hero's positive reinforcement aspects to support a PBIS framework. Now, the Santiago staff is putting Hero to use to systematically build up and maintain a healthy school climate. Every day, throughout Santiago's classrooms and hallways, administrators, teachers, and support staff recognize the student actions that contribute to a positive school climate. Recognition comes in the form of Hero points, or Shark Bytes as they're called at Santiago, which students earn for being present for office hours, showing responsibility, having integrity, achieving, being respectful, knowing themselves (\"Be a Shark\"), and demonstrating school spirit. Student Incentives That Work Points are instantaneously given and tallied digitally in the Hero app, making the process seamless and hassle-free for teachers. Since students can redeem their points for a variety of rewards, the points have become a real incentive – with students now actively seeking to earn points, says Bako. And they've become contagious as the adult recognition is encouraging positive student actions to spread across campus. \"Be a Shark is becoming common language around campus and in our community. Compared to the 2017-2018 school year, we've tripled the number of Shark Bytes we've rewarded for positive, expected behaviors this past school year,\" Bako adds. Demonstrating School Climate Improvement with Data While many educators struggle with documenting or communicating the way a school environment feels, Santiago is using Hero to measure school climate indicators. By fostering more students to demonstrate expected behaviors and school spirit, they're actively encouraging school connectedness and engagement – key components of school climate. \"By giving Shark Bytes for School Spirit, we've increased the number of students who participate on designated spirit days,\" confirms Bako. Positive Reinforcement for the Student Behaviors that Align with School Climate Logging into the administrator side of Hero allows the school to instantly glance at their data and check on program fidelity – then see how the positive climate is impacting student discipline. \"We are constantly looking at the number of Shark Bytes awarded by week, month, and quarter,\" says Bako. \"We are also seeing a decrease in the number of students seen for minor defiant/disrespectful behavior as recorded in our student management system.\" And to demonstrate climate improvements over time for the district or other stakeholders, the school can use Hero to generate reports that highlight their success. More Time for Learning Another positive the school can communicate is that, partly because of Hero, they've gained back valuable in-class instruction time. Still using the tool to reduce student tardies, Bako says, \"Hero has improved accountability and allowed us to start class right away.\" She reports that \"over the course of 3 and a half years, our unexcused tardies have reduced by 15%.\" Accountability among students is another indicator of climate, and by viewing their Hero program as a whole (tardiness and PBIS efforts together), the school has further evidence climate is improving. They're configured Hero to report tardiness as a \"negative\" behavior, while all the other behaviors they're reinforcing are \"positive\" ones. This produces a quick ratio of positive to negative student/adult interactions, which is instrumental to improving climate. \"We have a 9.3:1 positive to negative ratio,\" explains Bako – which is well beyond the recommended 4:1. Such a high ratio also helps demonstrate teachers have bought-in to the school's initiatives. \"We collect data so that we can course correct as needed and maximize the impact the program has on students and staff,\" Bako says. And at the end of the day, it's helpful to have hard numbers behind all the positivity they feel.

In many ways, Santiago is like many suburban-area high schools. They serve a diverse student population, are proud of their 99.7% graduation rate, and offer a multitude of athletics and extracurricular programs. Something else one might expect – and will – find at Santiago High is an exceptionally dedicated group of teachers and staff. Included in this team is Assistant Principal Melissa Bako. Skills for Career & College-Ready Success At just like so many high schools, the Santiago staff is deeply committed to the success of their students. And they know that building career and college ready young adults doesn't begin and end with academics. It's also about teaching students to be responsible and competent citizens. Students need these soft skills, they feel, when entering the workforce or post-secondary education. How is Santiago High doing that? It all comes down to the learning environment. Building Up Students and School Climate To create a schoolwide culture of positivity, staff and teachers use Hero. Initially, the high school implemented Hero to improve student tardiness. When Bako came to Santiago in the fall of 2016, she expanded the tool (which they're using LCAP funding to support) and the school is using Hero's positive reinforcement aspects to support a PBIS framework. Now, the Santiago staff is putting Hero to use to systematically build up and maintain a healthy school climate. Every day, throughout Santiago's classrooms and hallways, administrators, teachers, and support staff recognize the student actions that contribute to a positive school climate. Recognition comes in the form of Hero points, or Shark Bytes as they're called at Santiago, which students earn for being present for office hours, showing responsibility, having integrity, achieving, being respectful, knowing themselves (\"Be a Shark\"), and demonstrating school spirit. Student Incentives That Work Points are instantaneously given and tallied digitally in the Hero app, making the process seamless and hassle-free for teachers. Since students can redeem their points for a variety of rewards, the points have become a real incentive – with students now actively seeking to earn points, says Bako. And they've become contagious as the adult recognition is encouraging positive student actions to spread across campus. \"Be a Shark is becoming common language around campus and in our community. Compared to the 2017-2018 school year, we've tripled the number of Shark Bytes we've rewarded for positive, expected behaviors this past school year,\" Bako adds. Demonstrating School Climate Improvement with Data While many educators struggle with documenting or communicating the way a school environment feels, Santiago is using Hero to measure school climate indicators. By fostering more students to demonstrate expected behaviors and school spirit, they're actively encouraging school connectedness and engagement – key components of school climate. \"By giving Shark Bytes for School Spirit, we've increased the number of students who participate on designated spirit days,\" confirms Bako. Positive Reinforcement for the Student Behaviors that Align with School Climate Logging into the administrator side of Hero allows the school to instantly glance at their data and check on program fidelity – then see how the positive climate is impacting student discipline. \"We are constantly looking at the number of Shark Bytes awarded by week, month, and quarter,\" says Bako. \"We are also seeing a decrease in the number of students seen for minor defiant/disrespectful behavior as recorded in our student management system.\" And to demonstrate climate improvements over time for the district or other stakeholders, the school can use Hero to generate reports that highlight their success. More Time for Learning Another positive the school can communicate is that, partly because of Hero, they've gained back valuable in-class instruction time. Still using the tool to reduce student tardies, Bako says, \"Hero has improved accountability and allowed us to start class right away.\" She reports that \"over the course of 3 and a half years, our unexcused tardies have reduced by 15%.\" Accountability among students is another indicator of climate, and by viewing their Hero program as a whole (tardiness and PBIS efforts together), the school has further evidence climate is improving. They're configured Hero to report tardiness as a \"negative\" behavior, while all the other behaviors they're reinforcing are \"positive\" ones. This produces a quick ratio of positive to negative student/adult interactions, which is instrumental to improving climate. \"We have a 9.3:1 positive to negative ratio,\" explains Bako – which is well beyond the recommended 4:1. Such a high ratio also helps demonstrate teachers have bought-in to the school's initiatives. \"We collect data so that we can course correct as needed and maximize the impact the program has on students and staff,\" Bako says. And at the end of the day, it's helpful to have hard numbers behind all the positivity they feel.

      "When asked how to characterize Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, teachers Jessica Hedley and Kelly McManus beam that students and fellow staff make each day special. \"Everyone works so hard and encourages each other to succeed,\" they say. Located in Charlotte, North Carolina, MLK Jr. is a Title 1 school with a diverse student population. And the story of how they've gotten to the place where they are today, where progress is unfolding daily, isn't your typical \"school improvement\" story. In many ways, MLK Jr. is the kind of school many dream to work at or attend. With the help of strong leadership – \"we have a wonderful principal\" the teachers say – and plenty of community partners, volunteers, and parent involvement, the school is focused on social-emotional learning and academic outcomes. \"We're very big on building leadership within the student population and we've adopted restorative practices,\" they add. Just a few years ago, however, the school did struggle in one area: discipline. According to Hendley and McManus, student tardiness, cell phone misuse, and other Tier 1 behaviors were causing significant disruptions on campus. They're careful not to blame students for the issue, explaining disciplinary issues were rather a consequence of the lack of consistency in the discipline policy. \"Our students are just like all students; they're brilliant. Students thrive with consistency and structure. Both are equally important to creating a safe environment,\" the teachers explain. \"Our students were craving that structure, consistency, and love.\" To bring structure – and to help set behavioral expectations, school leaders turned to Hero. For three years now, the school has been using the student behavior management platform. Hero offers educators a digital way to reinforce or redirect all kinds of student behavior , from tardiness to exhibiting kindness. Redirection usually comes in the form of warnings or other actions, while reinforcement can be done by awarding Hero points. Many schools using Hero opt to reinforce positive student actions by granting positive points whenever a student demonstrates a desired or productive behavior. But Hero is also highly configurable, and MLK Jr. has tailored the tool in an interesting way. MLK Jr. students start the month with a certain number of points in their Hero account. For classroom disruptions, tardiness, absences, cell phone misuse, or other behaviors the school wants to redirect, points are deducted from the student's account. At the end of the month, the students who have kept 90% of their points get access to an exclusive incentive. Incentives vary (to keep student interest up), but they have included talent shows, kickball tournaments, movies, hallway olympics, March Madness events, and guest speakers. Students are also grouped into \"houses\" at the school, and the house class that has kept the most amount of points is awarded a field trip, in addition to monthly incentives. \"Hero allows us to celebrate our students on a regular basis within each classroom, and now, students feel appreciated,\" says Hendley and McManus. \"As educators, it's easy to always notice the 'bad' behavior.\" But by teaching their students behavior expectations, the teachers feel they can actually set students up for success. The structure that the school was looking for has been created with Hero, and students know that they have to follow consistent behavior policies classroom to classroom, schoolwide. \"It's helped my classroom tenfold,\" Hendley says. MLK Jr. administrators are seeing the numerical results that are typical with Hero as well. In the first semester of the 2018-19 school year, for instance, tardies to class decreased by 86%, insubordination decreased by 61%, dress code violations have dropped by 95%, and cell phone misuse decreased by 100%. (These results are one of the reasons they've kept Hero going for three years now.) \"We have less discipline issues in class, and Hero has helped reduced the disciplinary drama,\" the teachers explain. Switching to a digital behavior improvement platform has also made the teachers' lives, and day-to-day school administration, a whole lot easier. \"We always had a dress code policy, but with Hero, it's just easier to monitor,\" Hendley and McManus say. Managing and documenting behaviors is an instant, seamless process now. And the configurability of the platform has been key. \"It's amazing how we were able to easily fit everything around Hero.\" Since administrators and teachers are using Hero, the whole school can work together toward the same goal. \"Our administrators look at reports and the teacher activity within Hero,\" explains the two teachers, and that's helping with program fidelity. Plus, the school is also happy they've met their growth stats for EVAAS data (North Carolina's statewide Educator Effectiveness Model). McManus adds that \"Hero has helped with the retention rate of teachers at our school.\" On the student side, engagement has gone up too, believes Hendley. \"Now that we're using Hero to document student behavior, students can't 'fly under the radar' or 'get lost.' Every student is connecting with someone. Every student knows there's at least one teacher who loves and supports them.\" When MLK Jr. educators have a MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) meeting, they're also turning to Hero. Reviewing student behavior data in the platform is helping to ensure that students are getting the support they need. And for family meetings, the staff is reviewing student behavior records in Hero, \"which has made conversations seamless,\" says Hendley and McManus. \"We don't know how we would get this done if it wasn't documented in Hero.\" At MLK Jr., the reduction in disciplinary incidents, the student engagement, and the other positive changes are huge wins for life on campus. But they're also helping improve school climate, and that's crucial for the final piece in the puzzle: creating a campus where everyone can succeed.
