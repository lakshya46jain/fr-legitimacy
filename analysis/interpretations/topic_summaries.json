      "In the modern workplace, security and human resources (HR) systems are increasingly interconnected, driven by the need for seamless operations and enhanced security. Physical Identity and Access Management (PIAM) platforms, such as Soloinsight's CloudGate, bridge this gap by integrating HR processes with Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) like Lenel, CCure, AMAG, and Genetec. This integration not only enhances security but also streamlines HR management, ensuring that access rights are managed efficiently and securely from hire to retire. The Convergence of HR Management and PIAM Traditionally, HR and security operated in silos, leading to inefficiencies and potential security risks. PIAM has redefined this dynamic by creating a unified platform where HR processes directly influence access control, ensuring that only the right people have access to the right areas at the right times. Streamlining Onboarding : The onboarding process can be complex, involving IT setup, physical access provisioning, and policy compliance. PIAM automates these tasks by syncing with HR systems, automatically assigning access levels based on role, department, and location. This integration eliminates manual errors, reduces administrative burden, and accelerates the onboarding process. Automating Access Requests : As employees progress in their roles, their access needs evolve. PIAM facilitates this by automating access requests, integrating approval workflows that ensure compliance with security policies. This not only enhances security but also improves employee satisfaction by reducing the wait time for access to essential areas. Adapting to Remote and Hybrid Workforces : The shift to remote and hybrid work models presents unique challenges for access management. PIAM addresses these by offering flexible, real-time access controls that adapt to changing work environments. For instance, employees working remotely can be granted temporary access to facilities, with all activities logged for audit purposes. The Role of Mobile Credentials: Apple Wallet and Google Wallet The introduction of Employee Badge in Apple Wallet and Corporate Badge in Google Wallet marks a significant evolution in access management. These mobile credentials not only enhance convenience but also bring a higher level of security, seamlessly integrating with PIAM systems like CloudGate. Simplified Access and Enhanced Security : With mobile credentials, employees can use their smartphones to access secure areas, bypassing the need for physical cards. This shift is particularly advantageous in large organizations, where managing physical badges can be cumbersome. Moreover, mobile credentials are secured by biometric authentication (e.g., Face ID, Touch ID), providing an additional layer of security against unauthorized access. Seamless Integration with PIAM : CloudGate's integration with Apple Wallet and Google Wallet allows organizations to manage mobile credentials with the same rigor as traditional badges. This includes real-time access revocation, usage monitoring, and comprehensive reporting for compliance purposes. The flexibility and security offered by mobile credentials make them a forward-thinking choice for modern enterprises. Leveraging Attestation Reports and Analytics in HR Management One of the most powerful features of modern PIAM platforms is the ability to generate detailed Attestation Reports and leverage analytics to enhance HR management. Ensuring Regulatory Compliance : In industries like healthcare, finance, and government, regulatory compliance is non-negotiable. PIAM systems like CloudGate provide detailed Attestation Reports, offering a transparent overview of who has access to what areas. This ensures that access rights are aligned with regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of non-compliance. Optimizing Workforce Efficiency : By analyzing access data, HR teams can identify inefficiencies in space utilization and workforce management. For example, if certain areas are consistently underutilized, access controls can be adjusted to optimize resource allocation, leading to potential cost savings. Proactive Security Management : Attestation Reports and analytics enable HR and security teams to proactively manage risks. For instance, unusual access patterns can be flagged and investigated, allowing organizations to address potential security threats before they escalate. Modern PIAM vs. Legacy Systems: A Comparative Analysis As organizations evolve, so do their security needs. Legacy PIAM systems, while once adequate, now fall short in the face of modern challenges. Here's how modern platforms like CloudGate surpass their predecessors: Integration and Automation : Legacy Systems : Often plagued by integration issues, legacy systems require manual updates and maintenance, leading to inefficiencies and increased risk.

CloudGate's PIAM system offers a visitor management module that simplifies visitor access, ensuring security without compromising convenience. Pre-Registered Visitor Access: Tenants can pre-register visitors, allowing them to receive temporary access credentials on their mobile devices. Visitor Credential Expiration : The system automatically revokes visitor access after their scheduled visit, ensuring they cannot return without re-authorization. Enhancing Security and Convenience with PIAM In multi-tenant buildings, each floor or suite often serves a unique purpose and requires its own security protocols. Some tenants may operate high-security areas , such as data centers or executive suites, while others may have more flexible access needs. CloudGate enables multi-level access control, allowing tenants to customize access permissions for different areas within their leased space. Floor and Zone-Based Access: Tenants can restrict access to specific floors, suites, or rooms based on role, clearance, or department, allowing for granular control. Tenant-Managed Permissions: Each tenant can manage its own access policies, freeing building management from the responsibility of day-to-day access adjustments. Flexible Access with Mobile-Based Credentials With CloudGate's PIAM system, multi-tenant buildings can offer mobile-based access credentials to tenants (like employee badge in Apple Wallet ), streamlining the check-in process and providing added security. Employees and visitors can use their mobile devices to access designated areas, reducing the need for physical badges and increasing convenience. Contactless Access: Mobile credentials allow for contactless access, minimizing the need for physical interaction with entry points. Real-Time Credential Updates: Access permissions can be updated remotely, ensuring tenants always have accurate access levels without needing new badges. Example : A corporate tower implemented mobile-based access for tenants, resulting in faster check-in times and reduced congestion at entry points during peak hours. Real-Time Monitoring and Tenant Security Oversight For facility managers, monitoring multiple tenants with unique access points and high traffic is a complex task. CloudGate's PIAM platform centralizes security monitoring, allowing security teams to track access across all tenant spaces in real time. Centralized Access Dashboard: Building security can monitor access events from all tenants in a single dashboard, ensuring quick identification and response to any security concerns.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Politics and International Relations This course is taught by academic staff from Politics and International Relations, part of the School of Social Sciences. Our BSc Politics and Sociology offers a range of compulsory and optional modules to enable students to gain a comprehensive grounding in the two disciplines at the same time as tailoring their studies to their specific interests. The academic year is divided into two semesters of 15 weeks each. Each semester consists of a period of teaching, revision/directed learning and assessment. The structure of our programmes follow clear educational aims that are tailored to each programme. These are all outlined in the programme specifications which include further details such as the learning outcomes.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

BSc (Hons) with placement BSc (Hons) with foundation year BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement Year 1 - BSc (Hons) This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. Optional modules for Year 3 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Professional Training Year (PTY) Semester 1 & 2 This module supports students' development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement. It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment. The PTY module is concerned with Personal and Professional Development towards holistic academic and non-academic learning, and is a process that involves self-reflection, documented via the creation of a personal record, planning and monitoring progress towards the achievement of personal objectives. Development and learning may occur before and during the placement, and this is reflected in the assessment model as a progressive process. However, the graded assessment takes place primarily towards the end of the placement. Additionally, the module aims to enable students to evidence and evaluate their placement experiences and transfer that learning to other situations through written and presentation skills.

Optional modules for Professional Training Year (PTY) - Students select one of POLP025, POLP026, POLP0276 depending on the type of PTY year they are engaging in. BSc (Hons) with foundation year The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. Semester 1 & 2 The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences. Optional modules for Foundation - FHEQ Level 3 For further information on FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6 please view the programme specification for the full-time BSc (Hons) Politics and Sociology programme.

We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory.

POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations.

In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students must complete a total of 120 credits. All modules are optional. In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality.

In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. View full module details The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details Semester 2 Optional The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students must complete a total of 120 credits. All modules are optional. In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. View full module details This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. View full module details Optional modules for Year 1 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques.

It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations.

In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. View full module details This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study.

BSc (Hons) with placement BSc (Hons) with foundation year BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement Year 1 - BSc (Hons) This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. Optional modules for Year 1 - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. The module is concerned with understanding the source, practice, effect and response to terrorism in the modern world. In particular, the objective is to provide students with a clearer understanding of how and why terrorism exists and how other political actors respond to it. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module investigates the relationship between state and market in East and West by discussing views on philosophical ideas of democracy, development and justice. The module will build upon theoretical perspectives, ranging from Marxism to neo-liberalism. The students will analyse the practical policy applications of these theories as they have been manifested through neo-liberal politics, the Welfare State model and particularly the Development State model. Topical case studies will focus on East-Asia. The region allows for a critical discussion of major economic models and how they function as justification for particular regime forms and vice versa. Students will engage in debates over the socio-political consequences of economic and political transformations. It therefore builds on understanding of political and social philosophy on questions of welfare and justice acquired in POL1014 and more fundamentally on skills and knowledge obtained in POL2038 as it will deepen discussions on developmental strategies and state-market relations in political economy. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Semester 1 & 2 The Dissertation is an opportunity for students to explore a subject of their choosing in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible, applying their knowledge, understanding and skills to a particular question. Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study. Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students must complete a total of 120 credits. All modules are optional. In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module offers an introduction to British Politics, exploring the key institutions of the political system (monarchy, Government, Parliament, parties), recent political challenges (Europe, the role of the media, devolution) and options for reform. We will also examine the role of non-state actors in reshaping British politics; from environmental and sustainability activism to public petitions.Students will cement their knowledge of our parliamentary democracy and place this in the current political context. The module content links to other modules of comparative politics, public policy and political science in Levels 5 and 6. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module introduces the discipline of International Relations, exploring key global events and their interrelationship with the development of theoretical perspectives. It will form the basis of student knowledge and analytical training for more advanced modules. Students will be introduced to both mainstream and critical perspectives, exploring both their basis in philosophy and their practical applications in analysis. They will also explore empirical case areas that present major challenges in international politics and current affairs, including developments on environment and climate change, security, human rights and globalisation. This module serves as a broad introduction to the theoretical study of politics. It introduces students to key political thinkers and then, in the second semester, discusses how some their political ideas have informed political ideologies. The module will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the western political tradition of political thinking from Ancient Greece to Fukuyama¿s End of History. Optional modules for Year 1 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 4 All modules in Year 1 are compulsory. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement In this class, we build on students' understanding of research skills introduced at Level 1. We investigate in depth the basic assumptions that inform social scientific research including philosophical issues such as the source of knowledge in social science. We will review different quantitative and qualitative methodologies employed in political science such as experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis, document analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic research, case studies and comparative analysis, and practice on designing solid research projects that will require application of one of the above methods to solve a specific political puzzle. The development of skills around these methods can help you with future modules and assignments, but beyond they can help you develop a set of skills for employment, raising your awareness on global and cultural issues of interest, and help you understand how we can become resilient researchers who understand how to find solutions to problems and real-life tasks. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. This innovative, interdisciplinary and university-wide module explores multiple aspects of popular culture in the contemporary world. The module considers how and why some works acquire the status of popular culture and how these works permeate everyday life. Through an overview of contemporary issues and approaches to popular culture in social, literary, filmic, musical and sociological contexts, you will consider the values inherent in some cultural works, and how these transform to reflect societal preoccupations. You will examine case studies from Dickens through Disney to the Diva, considering the creative choices and the critical reception. This module will equip you with a sophisticated understanding of the academic approaches to culture which will inform and illuminate your work in other disciplines. In particular the module embeds the University Pillars of Resourcefulness & Resilience, Digital Capabilities, Global and Cultural Capabilities. This original module is delivered by staff specialising in diverse forms of popular culture across the university, including from the Department of Music and Media, School of Literature and Languages and GSA. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Following one of the most controversial administrations in recent history, this module situates the Trump presidency in the context of other executives and considers to what extent this period was a major departure for norms and strategy in US foreign policy. It considers recent history, theory and key concepts to reflect on the impact both for US power projection, and on world politics more generally. The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment.

It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation.

Supported by general and specific guidance, the student will be able to pull together much of their degree and (where applicable) start to look towards post-graduate study. Optional modules for Year 3 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 6 Students must complete a total of 120 credits. All modules are optional. In Semester 1, students can select only one of: POL3065 US FOREIGN POLICY POL3090 POLITICS OF THE GREATER CHINA REGION Students taking the dissertation module should select no more than 3 additional modules in either Semester 1 or Semester 2. POL2027 - APPROACHES TO RESEARCH requires students to have obtained 55% or above in their final mark to select POL3061 DISSERTATION in the final year. Professional Training Year (PTY) Semester 1 & 2 This module supports students' development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement. It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment. The PTY module is concerned with Personal and Professional Development towards holistic academic and non-academic learning, and is a process that involves self-reflection, documented via the creation of a personal record, planning and monitoring progress towards the achievement of personal objectives. Development and learning may occur before and during the placement, and this is reflected in the assessment model as a progressive process. However, the graded assessment takes place primarily towards the end of the placement. Additionally, the module aims to enable students to evidence and evaluate their placement experiences and transfer that learning to other situations through written and presentation skills.

Optional modules for Professional Training Year (PTY) - Students must choose 1 of the above 3 modules. BSc (Hons) with foundation year The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies.

The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Politics and International Relations This course is taught by academic staff from Politics and International Relations, part of the School of Social Sciences. Our BSc Politics and Sociology offers a range of compulsory and optional modules to enable students to gain a comprehensive grounding in the two disciplines at the same time as tailoring their studies to their specific interests. The academic year is divided into two semesters of 15 weeks each. Each semester consists of a period of teaching, revision/directed learning and assessment. The structure of our programmes follow clear educational aims that are tailored to each programme. These are all outlined in the programme specifications which include further details such as the learning outcomes.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences. View full module details Optional modules for Foundation - FHEQ Level 3 For further information on FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6 please view the programme specification for the full-time BSc (Hons) Politics and Sociology programme. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Optional This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. View full module details Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences. View full module details Optional modules for Foundation - FHEQ Level 3 For further information on FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6 please view the programme specification for the full-time BSc (Hons) Politics and Sociology programme. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. View full module details This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. View full module details This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. View full module details Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Compulsory This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. View full module details A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. View full module details Optional This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. View full module details International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. View full module details The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. View full module details Optional This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches View full module details Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. View full module details This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. View full module details This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. View full module details Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. View full module details The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. View full module details This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies.

Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement Semester 1 Optional The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. View full module details In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism View full module details This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. View full module details The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. View full module details This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. View full module details In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. View full module details This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens View full module details This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. View full module details Semester 2 Optional This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? View full module details This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. View full module details This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. View full module details This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. View full module details This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). View full module details The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space View full module details Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study View full module details Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme.

BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement Semester 1 Compulsory The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. View full module details This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. View full module details Semester 2 Compulsory The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. View full module details This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. View full module details Semester 1 & 2 Compulsory The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

BSc (Hons) with foundation year BSc (Hons) with placement BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement Year 1 - BSc (Hons) This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. Optional modules for Year 3 - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. BSc (Hons) with foundation year The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. Semester 1 & 2 The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences. Optional modules for Foundation - FHEQ Level 3 For further information on FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6 please view the programme specification for the full-time BSc (Hons) Politics and Sociology programme. Year 1 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module introduces students to the history and origins of the discipline of Sociology. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the historical conditions that allowed key theorists to start questioning and conceptualising the social world around them. Students will learn about these key theorists by exploring how they comprehensively attempted to explain how social order was maintained within the social world. We explore the work of Durkheim, Marx and Weber who, collectively, are often assigned the title of the 'founding fathers' of the discipline. Students learn about the differing conceptions of the social world so that, by the end of the module, they can employ three differing perspectives to understand the organisation and complexity of the social world. The overall aim is for students to understand three different approaches to conceptualising the social world and to appreciate the legacy in thought each approach has instilled in us as sociologists. The module provides an opportunity for students to investigate and discuss critical issues in both domestic and international politics. As such the module content will respond to key contemporary developments ensuring that students are able to employ their analytical skills gained through their semester 1 L4 modules (particularly POL 1012 and POL 1013). Typically the module will cover such issues as nationalism, problems stemming from globalisation, international conflicts, the cross-cutting instrumentality of environmental / sustainability policy, democratic and economic crises as well as matters related to identity, inclusivity and intersectionality. Semester 1 & 2 This module introduces students to qualitative and quantitative approaches to research design, methodology and data analysis. Part A focuses on qualitative field methods, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation, and their place within the wider research process. Students will explore the insights and possibilities generated by qualitative research as well as some of the challenges that qualitative researchers may encounter. Part B is designed to introduce students to the statistical techniques necessary for implementing and critically evaluating quantitative social research. Emphasis will be put on when and how data is collected, how to use basic statistical techniques to analyse the data appropriately, and how to interpret results. Students will also acquire a familiarity with R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. This module offers students a first introduction to the study of political science, with an overall objective to set the foundations for developing a cultural and global diversity mindset, employability skills, digital capabilities, sustainable thinking, resourcefulness and resilience in the study of politics. Students engage with a set of key concepts of political science, questions and debates at the heart of the discipline. The module is a foundational window to the functioning of political systems and processes, key theories of political science and insights into the way important societal developments affect politics in any country context. Moreover, this module will teach and encourage students to start critically reflecting on social and political trends around the world, as well as set the foundations to become independent thinkers in analysing political developments and events.¿ It simultaneously introduces students to some of the most relevant issues and debates surrounding challenges to representation across different global and cultural contexts. Drawing on different perspectives from across political science, this module offers an opportunity to consider the ways in which citizens' opinions and preferences are constructed, as well as how politics and political agents account (or not) for them. The module will employ a mixture of case studies from different national contexts and largely rely on comparative evidence as well as simulation scenarios to explore key issues and deepen students' knowledge of representation and its challenges. The case studies are designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of various aspects of representation and some of its principal challenges, being able to transfer learnings and skills forward to other modules as well as further afield in their career. This module provides students with a broad introduction to the changing nature of contemporary societies through a focus on key substantive topics in sociology. Students will learn about the core social divisions and social identities that are so important to sociological analysis, including social class, gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexuality and religion. We will also examine significant social contexts and institutions within which social processes take place, including family, education, economy/work, health/medicine, community, government/ state, science/technology, media, environment and globalisation. By considering the ways in which sociologists have conceptualised and researched these topics, students will explore their continued significance for twenty first century societies as well as individual lives. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear understanding of social inequalities and differences, alongside the social contexts and institutions that shape and are shaped by them. Year 2 - BSc (Hons) with placement This module will introduce students to the main debates and methods associated with policy analysis. It covers key traditional theoretical concepts used in public policy analysis such as pluralism, elitism as well as more contemporary approaches and developments such as evidence based policy making. To that end, students will be called to apply the theoretical concepts and ideas around public policy making and the research design techniques for public policy analysis into real-life scenario based exercises, risk management and mitigation of policy implementation, agenda-setting and problem solving exercises in a variety of policy areas of their choice. They can draw examples from different national and international settings, touching upon any policy area, from sustainability and environmental protection, to security, immigration, asylum, foreign policy, education and welfare provision, public health and institutional design for policy making. Students will get the opportunity of analysing data and evidence that they collect in traditional and digital ways, enhancing their resilience in facing research caveats and their resourcefulness in thinking about workarounds to problems. Finally, the module provides students with transferable skills in policy analysis and policy briefing applicable to a range of Level 6 modules, their dissertation projects and other policy related assignments, as well as in their quest for future career and placement prospects in policy-related workplaces. A number of key global challenges are introduced in this module, focusing on the valuable contribution social research can make to addressing issues such as climate emergency and sustainable living, food insecurity, precarious work and resilience, energy crisis and health inequalities. We examine the role of research in developing, evaluating and improving policy at local, national and global levels. The process of policy making is studied at its different stages, how researchers can contribute and the types of interventions that are possible and effective. Only by understanding this process can research be designed and communicated in appropriate ways to inform policy and change behaviour, so increasing the value of the research, of the work of the researcher and the impact the research has. The concept of research impact is explored as part of the module, in of making a positive contribution to improve practices, as well as in of academic agendas for impactful research and its relationship to funding. In particular, we employ the latest Research Evaluation Framework (REF) Impact Case Studies to explore good examples of impactful research. This also serves to reinforce an understanding of the relationship between good project design and research outcomes, and provides an opportunity to showcase the impactful work of Surrey University staff. Students will have the opportunity to study a series of specific social challenges, with access to academic experts sharing the challenges, recommendations and impacts of the research they have contributed to address these. Not only does this enable research-led teaching, but students will build up an understanding of the specific global challenges and policy areas, as well as what the research, policy making and evaluation career pathways can involve. This module enables students to gain a solid understanding of key theories of International Political Economy (IPE) such as Mercantilism, Liberalism and Marxism. It strongly emphasises the political, philosophical and ethical aspects of IPE and is therefore more in-line with studies of Political Theory and Philosophy rather than Classical Economics. It therefore builds on a good understanding of International Relations, the links between history and theory and experience with empirical case studies acquired in POL1013. It deepens knowledge in political and social philosophy acquired in POL1014, specifically on questions of liberty, welfare, and justice. The acquired knowledge should be applied in a critical fashion for the analysis of case studies. Multi-national corporations and institutions in the International Trade and Monetary System are introduced as key actors in the international political economic environment. Students will be able to discuss and debate the role of these institutions in the development of, and their behaviour during, crises, with focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Current and future challenges to the status quo of IPE are discussed as well. The acquired knowledge on state and market relations, the focus on non-Western case studies together with presentation and communication skills directly link the module to Level 6 modules POL3090 and POL3072. International migration has increasingly become a focus of attention across a range of academic disciplines as well as for politicians, policy makers and the media. Various factors - and combinations of factors - global political and economic restructuring, mobilities, conflicts, ambitions – mean more people move across international boundaries. With the increasing movement of people governments in Britain and Europe have been tightening control on the entry of migrants and making entry ever more conditional. As countries in the Global North recognise the need to recruit migrants to fill labour shortages a 'managed migration' approach has driven national government's migration policy. Managed migration means an increasingly selectivity about who is allowed to cross borders. This creates highly differentiated status and rights given to the different categories of migrant. The arrival and settlement of migrant populations in countries of destination like the UK and other European nations has meant an increasingly preoccupied with social exclusion, social cohesion and integration. The policy approaches that have developed out of these concerns are often controversial and seen a rise in the numbers of residents with insecure statuses, and emphasised divisions between migrants and citizens, and between migrants with different legal statuses. These issues, debates and policies have profound and on-going implications for processes of identity, belonging and multiculture. This module builds upon the research methods training which students received in their first year to provide students with a more robust understanding of some of the main quantitative analysis approaches in the social sciences. Students will learn about multivariate quantitative analyses with the help of R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. They will investigate a range of topics in sociology and criminology by accessing suitable secondary data from the UK Data Service, analysing data using R, and interpreting and presenting the results of quantitative analyses. The form of globalisation that has characterised the international system over the post-Cold War era, a phenomenon that both drives and is driven by international institutions, treaties and regimes, is seemingly reducing the capacity of nation-states to respond to pressures emanating from the international economic and security environment. Economic challenges, including the recent global recession, require intimate cross-border cooperation (at the regional and global level); climate change presents a threat that requires urgent global-cooperation (be it between local authorities and cities in different national contexts, or at the national level), and public health continues to have drastic impacts on economy, development, and wellbeing that reach beyond individual states. Furthermore, the end of the Cold War has ushered in a host of new security challenges that states are unable to tackle on an individual basis, from preventing and dealing with the consequences of state failure, international terrorism and crime, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A key question that the module will examine is the extent to which these challenges are leading to a shift away from an international system characterized by the notion of state sovereignty and the control of policy development and implementation by the central political authority of the nation-state, to a diffusion of power and competencies, both 'horizontally', to private actors such as NGOs and Transnational Corporations, and 'vertically', downwards to the regional level and upwards to international organisations. The module will critically assess the analytical leverage that can be attained to these questions through the application of diverse perspectives within IR theories, covering not only realist, liberal, and constructivist schools of thought, but also critical approaches such as Marxism and post-structuralism. It will also focus on approaches drawn from political science theory, notably the literatures on multi-level governance, public policy theories, and the 'new' institutionalism. In the course students will tackle a number of contemporary debates on international organisations that are central to public debate - the meaning and forms of international organisations, issues of authority, power and legitimacy; how states and non-state actors (particularly NGOs and business) have shaped the nature and scope of international cooperation and the effects that participation in international institutions upon policy-making, styles of governance and institutional configuration at the national and sub-national levels. We will also examine not only the role of hegemonic powers, in particular the impact of the United States over the post-war and post-Cold War eras, but also the implications of the rise of new powers such as China and India upon international organisations. The module will then examine relevant case studies: environmental governance; global health governance; the WTO and the governance of international trade; the IMF, World Bank and the governance of finance and development; the United Nations and security governance. The module will conclude by assessing the implications of the growth of international organisations for the role of the state as a national and international actor. The module lays a theoretical foundation for empirical studies of modern governmental structures. It offers students an understanding of the structures of governments, the variations in state organisation, governmental forms and party systems. In particular, it will examine the main elements of the modern democratic state in a comparative manner, stressing both the commonalities and differences between systems around the world. Technically, the module will provide students with the basic ideas and skills that will serve them for further study of both comparative government and individual case studies, as well as introducing them to core literature in the field. The mdule seeks to develop research and analytical skills useful to the research of comparative politics. It also expands notions of democracies to discuss non-Western democratic models and key examples from authoritarian and illiberal states from around the world to discuss democratic challenges. We bring forward comparative analysis on social movements and political participation, highlighting movements like gender and race equality, autonomy, environmental and climate change movements, from a comparative point of view, including the value of protesting. We focus therefore both on the formal and informal side of political life with a view to master comparative research techniques. This second-year module builds upon the knowledge of sociological theory and classical sociological thinkers that students have developed in their first year of studies. However, the focus shifts to forms of sociological thinking with an ostensibly critical intent. It examines critical sociological perspectives within their socio-historical context, a global context, and in relation to such broad issues as the nature of social organisation, the workings of power and capitalism, modes of everyday behaviour, inequalities, culture, social change and environmental degradation. It also considers the contemporary value and applicability of each critical sociological perspective and of the critical sociological enterprise more generally. Some themes and issues recur and are developed throughout the module: the conceptualisation of power in social theory the relationship between culture, economy and nature in conceptualisations of power the types of sociologically significant hierarchies the critical understanding of the influence of sociological factors on the construction of knowledge the relation between different critical approaches Work is important for individuals, for identity and survival, and for society, for stability and productiveness. This module focuses on the changing role of work, what impacts how it is experienced, and how theoretical approaches both inform and are informed by the study of working life. Students will explore the concept of work and its representation through different media, including film, music, fiction, art, photography, and virtual, augmented and mixed realities. The module offers a global perspective at its core, appreciating the importance of rooted historical accounts and diversity of cultural experience, but recognising the interconnectivity of issues of work and employment (as well as the lack of it) in the global economy. Students will also consider the future of work, its sustainability and connect this to employability, equipping students to evaluate their own work experience, resilience and career aspirations from a sociological perspective. This module builds on students' existing knowledge of electoral systems and voting behaviour. It will give students an understanding of the implications of the use of particular electoral systems in different contexts and how people vote. Through the examination of existing theories and analytical frameworks, students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections. Students will develop their ability to analyse the results of contemporary elections, the emergence on new political parties, and the contemporary developments in party systems. The module enables students to critically apply key voter's behaviour theories to contemporary elections and understand strategies through which participation in voting can be encouraged. Together we will examine both parties and voters, and through the analysis of case studies we will examine contemporary debates on voting behavior. The module complements and expands elements of UK politics electoral systems featured in POL1017 (Debates in British Politics) and on theories of voting behaviour such as rational choice which have been discussed in POL1012 (Introduction to Politics). There are no pre-requisites for this module. Students have the opportunity and are asked to carry out independent research. This module builds upon the research methods training which students receive in their first year in order to provide students with a more detailed understanding of qualitative methods. While recognising interplay between the different stages, this module is structured around the general stages of conducting qualitative research - planning, conducting, analysing and writing about qualitative research. Students will learn about new developments in qualitative research including creative and visual methods, different types of ethnographies and mobile methodologies. They will also enhance their skill set by learning different methods of analysing qualitative data including computer assisted qualitative data analysis. Communication is a key skill in the information society, from making sense of the world around you to making yourself heard in different settings, including university, work, with friends and family, and in society. This module will introduce students to key concepts in communication as they are relevant to communicating in 21st century society. Accounting for the fact that most of our communication is mediated in some way, the module will give students a strong contextual understanding in mediated communication. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to communication in which students will learn about the way we communicate and understand communication in a range of areas, including business, medical settings, science, language, and psychology. The 'long' 20th Century was full of contradiction: devastating world wars, intra-state conflict, revolution and economic disaster were met with recognition of the right of peoples to determine their own future, of an international human rights agenda, of unprecedented systemic institution-building in order to promote and perpetuate peace and economic growth that extended far beyond the ¿first world¿. This module will review key events and processes shaping the evolution of contemporary international society in order to identify and understand the circumstances under which such major change came about. Students will be required to acquire a detailed knowledge and understanding of international history and actors in the twentieth century, developing, applying, and historically contextualising their knowledge of International Relations theory. The module engages the global and cultural structures of power within which the discipline of International Relations is embedded; the evolution of capitalism and the sustainability of contemporary international political economy; and the resourcefulness and resilience required for processes of revolutionary change. This module will introduce students to quantitative research methods, with particular focus on current examples from politics building on POL2027 Approaches to Research. In this module students will be introduced to the basic concepts, methods, and techniques used in quantitative analysis and are necessary for understanding developments in politics and IR and decisions taken by the government and other public organisations. This module will also provide students with the skills necessary and the practical experience of using quantitative data and techniques of analysing it. This way students will learn new in-demand skills, not only for their studies but also skills they can highlight in their CVs. The course uses the statistical software RStudio, and you will learn how to critical evaluate research questions by using them most important surveys available. Students will also learn skills they can apply at their dissertation and into assignments during the final year of their studies. Semester 1 & 2 This module presents an overview of European integration and related political structures. It further discusses the various social, political and historical forces that have influenced the establishment of European integration in its current form. Optional modules for Year 2 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 5 For further information regarding programme structure and module selection, please refer to the course catalogue . Year 3 - BSc (Hons) with placement The module will cover the basic elements of negotiation, using a combination of theoretical and practical methods. The module introduces theoretical approaches to negotiation, before exploring and illustrating them through active usage in a series of games and exercises. Negotiations in class (weekly) as well as online (throughout the duration of the semester) allow students to address real-life political issues in the form of simulations. The taught theoretical insights are put to practice with tailored seminar activities. More importantly, students are required to evaluate their practice in a self-reflexive critical portfolio that will be based on the experience built throughout the semester. This will test their grasp of the topic as well as give them the opportunity to consider how it will inform their future practices as a 'negotiator' within employment. In a time of increasing challenges to the core components of representative democracy, this course provides an introduction to populism in theory and practice, employing an increasingly consensual ideational approach to populism. It introduces participants to an extensive conceptual debate, historical and current populist forces, their characteristics, causes and consequences, as well as the often-ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. This course aims to introduce students to some of the most relevant issues and debates revolving around populism, its causes and consequences. Readings and activities have been carefully selected to deepen students' knowledge of specific cases. They are also designed to build more general critical thinking and analytical skills that students can use to form their own understanding of the relationship between populism and democracy, as well as present their views in both oral and written formats, developing a global perspective on a topical issue of political culture. To do so, this module addresses the following main issues: concepts of populism (assessment of definitions and presentation of populism as a set of ideas) overview of populism amongst the masses and elites overview of populist forces in Europe, Latin America and the USA causes of populism consequences of populism, and most notably its ambivalent relationship with democracy implications of and responses to populism This module is concerned with understanding the role of leadership in the contemporary political environment. Much attention tends to be absorbed in observing institutional factors driving change, such as parties, parliaments and demography. However, this module establishes leadership as a vital factor in politics. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political leadership, including charisma and psychological approaches. It uses a range of examples to illustrate key dimensions of leadership and considers to what extend the requirement of political leadership have changed in response to the contemporary political environment. By examining leadership from a gender and dyadic perspective, the module also considers whether some nations have an issue in the accessibility of (and therefore representation by) leaders. It also examines key issues political leaders face; from exploring how they cope with conflict to how they keep their hands 'clean' of corruption. It also considers ways in which we can quantify how successful a leader is. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary political events and case studies will be situated throughout the module. The module explores human sexuality from diverse perspectives and across different topic areas, but central to the module is a sociological approach that regards sexuality as primarily a social construction. The module provides a global perspective on sexuality, drawing on studies and theories from many different societies, whilst paying attention to the historical and scientific roots of sexuality. Topics cover issues related to the diversity of experience related to sexuality and sexual identity, recognizing too the interconnectivity of sexuality with other social identities and sources of social division e.g gender, ethnicity, age, amongst others. The module covers several specific areas of sexuality, which allows students to connect academic topics with 'real-world' examples and write critically, analytically and logically thereby increasing employability. The module requires students to undertake individual and group level formative work, thereby enhancing skills of resourcefulness and resilience. This unit is concerned with understanding the role of political communication in contemporary politics. Arguably parties use the media to influence voters, but the media also has a role in holding (selected) politicians to account. This unit explores the various theoretical perspectives on the role of political communication and the media, before moving on to consider a series of empirical examples. The unit also covers key topics relevant to political communication including the relationship between political parties and the national media; whether it is the role of political broadcasts, televised debates, or the impact of rolling news coverage on the ability of politicians to control the media. It considers how changes in media have offered new opportunities for citizenship and democracy, including agenda setting. It also considers how parties and political organisations have adapted to use these new media. There is a focus on key issues in contemporary politics and case studies will be situated throughout the module. Students will also gain coding and content analysis skills in order to explore how key topical political themes are framed in political communication. The module complements and expands elements of POL 1012 (Introduction to Politics), particularly structuralist theories of the state. It will also complement knowledge gained of British politics in POL 1017 (Debates in British Politics). The coding and content analysis skills also build on knowledge gained in Approaches to Research (POL 2027); although this module is not a pre-requisite – full training will be given as part of this module. There are no pre-requisites for this module and students have the opportunity to carry out independent research on a media/theme of their choice for the critique assessment. In this module students will develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of International Relations in respect of both the discipline and the practice. The module builds on work done in previous modules, particularly POL1012 Intro to International Relations, POL1019 Contemporary International History, POL2038 International Political Economy, POL2029 Them and Us: Comparative Government and Politics and POL2030 Theorising International Relations. It is therefore expected that students will enter the module with a developed understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics theories and approaches with the aim of connecting these to the case studies discussed. The module provides an examination of the domestic-foreign policy linkages between China and the areas of the so-called Greater China region (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau) and beyond. It thus examines China in the broader context and focuses on its role in the region and beyond building on an understanding of the PRC's societal and institutional transformation. This will develop students' knowledge and understanding of China's growing role in the world while at the same time highlighting the linkages between the domestic and international sphere, the importance of socio-historical context and alternative approaches to analyse international relations. This module offers students an in-depth exploration of the relationship between education and wider society. Students will learn about different theoretical approaches used to understand this relationship, developments in education policy and practice over time and between different national contexts, and the significance of social characteristics such as class, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and religion on educational patterns and processes. We will examine themes such as attainment inequalities, curriculum knowledge, teaching and learning, discipline and citizenship, voice and identity, accommodating difference, family engagement with institutions, and the globalisation and internationalisation of education. The overall aim is to provide students with a clear knowledge and understanding of contemporary debates in education and the skills to critically evaluate these through a sociological lens This module introduces students to the role that travel and tourism plays within the sociological sphere of leisure. Students explore touristic motivations and desires through theory to understand how and why people choose the destination they travel to. In addition, students explore the wide range of experiences tourists have at these destinations using theory to explain their significance. The module also explores how the construction of touristic spaces and resorts impacts both the motivations and experiences of tourists. The module then examines weekly case studies of different forms of travel and tourism, for example, sex tourism, dark tourism, party-island travel, and gap years to implement the theoretical ideas developed in the first half of the module. By the end of the module, students are equipped with the skills to understand the construction of experiences from the touristic industries as well as how travel and tourism can create social and cultural inequalities. This module seeks to introduce students to a range of topics relating to the roles of gender structures and sexuality in defining world politics. The module will explore the complex interactions that underpin the relationship between the personal and the international. The module will look at key debates in feminist theorising, in order to show how the concepts of gender and sexuality require scholars to unpack key defining concepts such as \"masculinity†and \"femininityâ€. This will allow us to interrogate and critique a number of challenges facing world politics today such as, gender mainstreaming in politics and demographic trends, but also domestic politics and representation, who is representing whom, and how? This module centers around the core concepts of race, ethnicity, racism and intersectionality. It explores how modern society emerged and developed in tandem with the concept of race and strategies of racism. The module will examine the historical construction of race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before considering theoretical approaches to the study of race and gender, race and class, whiteness, multiculturalism and cultural racism, space and segregation, mixed-race studies and decolonisation. We will consider whether we are moving towards a 'post-race' society, and whether this is possible and indeed desirable. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing ethnicity, racism, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. This cutting-edge final year module introduces students to a range of key debates relating to European and EU security and diplomacy. Students are provided with a series of carefully scaffolded opportunities to engage in contemporary debates on Europe's ability to operate as a security and foreign policy actor, in national, bilateral and multilateral forms. In addition, the module offers insights, feedback, and assessment forms which cumulatively provide students with opportunities to engage in five key areas: employability, global and cultural capabilities, digital capabilities, sustainability, and resourcefulness and resilience. European Security and Diplomacy will provide students with in-depth opportunities to consider, analyse, synthesize and critique a wide range of current issues in security and diplomacy in Europe. In doing so, students are presented with first-hand opportunities to engage in a diverse European and international environment, allowing them to compare various political and cultural viewpoints. Students will develop an understanding of complex issues regarding European actors, institutions, policies, diplomatic and defence structures. In learning about the unique challenges facing European security and diplomacy, students will be provided with key opportunities to develop their capability for sustainable thinking e.g. in tackling governance issues directly connected to the EU's approach to climate change and sustainability), as well as medium and long-term options for European 'actorness' in relation to itself, and others. Students will be provided with a wide range of opportunities to apply relevant analytical, synthesis-based and critical thinking skills in in this module. The forms of assessment will further require students to invest in both independent and team-based work, strengthening their resourcefulness as young scholars, and deepening their forms of resilience in managing challenges. Give the wide range of conceptual, documentary, case-based and speech-related materials comprising this area, students will develop a range of research skills in tackling both classic and fast-moving contemporary political issues using a range of primary/secondary sources, including digital portals and repositories. This in turn will underwrite enhanced digital capabilities. Lastly, the sum total of various in-classroom skills, including developing debating and argumentation skills, alongside the range of soft skills connected to global awareness, digital capabilities, sustainability plus resourcefulness and resilience will cumulatively enable POL3087 students to augment their overall employability. This module focuses upon the development, characteristics and contemporary significance of a range of different aspects of youth culture in the context of mediated societies. Topics covered include the construction and development of understandings of adolescence as a distinct life course period, the relationship between youth and both traditional and digital forms of media, questions of class, ethnicity and gender, the significance of on and offline spaces, and debates relating to youth communities and subcultures. This course provides an opportunity to students taking all pathways to explore key topics in political science, such as: What is 'activism' in the age of social media; Who are the activists today; What are the motivations behind political activism; How do different organizational vehicles (parties, movements, NGOs, pressure groups) contribute to the functioning of democracy. The module links well to modules at Level 5 (such as POL2029 and POL2047) and at Level 6 (such as POL3081, POL3082, POL3088, POL3089). The purpose of this module is to connect theories of democratisation with their application to specific regions, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also beyond, looking at the post-Soviet space to understand the impact of EU Enlargement, demand and support for democracy in post-Communist Europe, and develop a wider knowledge of countries within this geographical space Since the US anti-Vietnam War movement, philosophical interest in armed conflict has increased considerably. Beginning with Michael Walzer's classic Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (1977), this module looks at key thinkers, themes, and ideas from contemporary just war theory and the ethics of armed conflict, mostly from within the analytical tradition of philosophy. Topics include the paradigm of self-defense and its critics, the moral status of combatants, the normative sources (and limits) of non-combatant immunity, the moral nature of terrorism, as well as the problem of intervention. The module concludes by examining more recent ethical challenges posed by remote-warfare, cyber warfare, and the prospect of robotic weapons. In studying these topics, students will not only gain a sound understanding of contemporary just war theory; they will also be introduced to key ideas and concepts from contemporary ethical and political theory. Finally, students will be able to apply the more abstract philosophical material discussed on the module to real-life events via an assessed Ethics Case Study Whilst the problem of hate crime has been, until relatively recently, largely neglected as a distinct area of criminological research in the UK and around the world, changes to political, criminal and social justice agendas have given hate crime much greater significance over the past 30 years or so. This module is therefore designed to provide students with a broad historical, theoretical, and contemporary understanding of the key issues relating to hate crime. Particular focus is placed on examining the different forms that hate crime can take and the impact it can have on victims and wider communities, whilst the motivations behind hate crime perpetration are also explored, as are the various legal and wider criminal justice and other relevant responses to it, all within an international context. Students are also encouraged to think critically about issues relating to identity politics, diversity, and the broader social construction of contemporary crime problems. The module relates to the degree programme more broadly by discussing policing, victimisation, legislation, the criminal justice system, offending, social justice, and notions of identity and diversity, within the hate crime context. As such it builds upon previous learning that students will have undertaken in prior modules throughout the first two years of their degree programme. Optional modules for Year 3 (with PTY) - FHEQ Level 6 Students can mix and match from either offering, but should at the end of the year have 4 Politics and 4 Sociology modules on their diet. Professional Training Year (PTY) Semester 1 & 2 This module supports students' development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement. It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment. The PTY module is concerned with Personal and Professional Development towards holistic academic and non-academic learning, and is a process that involves self-reflection, documented via the creation of a personal record, planning and monitoring progress towards the achievement of personal objectives. Development and learning may occur before and during the placement, and this is reflected in the assessment model as a progressive process. However, the graded assessment takes place primarily towards the end of the placement. Additionally, the module aims to enable students to evidence and evaluate their placement experiences and transfer that learning to other situations through written and presentation skills.

Optional modules for Professional Training Year (PTY) - Students select one of POLP025, POLP026, POLP0276 depending on the type of PTY year they are engaging in. BSc (Hons) with foundation year and placement The module examines law in a social, ethical, political, historical, and international context. Students will be introduced to the English Legal System and analyse how laws in England and Wales are implemented. The focus will be on contemporary issues, to illustrate how academic studies relate to law in practice and the impact it has on society. It requires students to examine how public opinion, politics and the media influence lawmakers and provides students with a variety of transferable employability skills including group work and self-reflection. This module introduces students to key contemporary issues in sociology, media and communication, and criminology. Students will build foundational knowledge across these three disciplines by exploring a range of core concepts, themes, and approaches. In sociology, students will engage in topics such as social inequality, globalization, and identity. In media and communication, key debates around the impact of digital media, representation, and media ownership will be explored. Criminology will introduce students to issues such as criminal justice, deviance, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The focus of the module is to encourage students to think critically about the social world and the structures they reside in, applying interdisciplinary perspectives to understand and address contemporary issues. Through examining real-world case studies, students will learn how research in these fields can offer valuable insights into the functioning of society and contribute to solving pressing social challenges, such as inequality, crime, and media influence. The module: Provides an overview of the core characteristics of contemporary political issues Introduces distinctions between and demonstrate interactivity between empirical and conceptual frameworks for understanding those issues Introduces key domestic and international political institutions Introduces students to key research and concepts on domestic and international politics Introduces problem areas such as Ideology, Brexit, Populism, Representation, Security. This module will involve students collaborating on a group project, with a primary emphasis on addressing issues within their respective subject areas that serve the public interest and promote the common good. After participating in a series of preparatory lectures, student groups will actively engage in addressing a societal need, scoping out the problem, defining a solution, executing the plan, and measuring its impact. Subsequently, they will present their solution to an academic panel and, where relevant, the appropriate social stakeholders. In addition to their group efforts, each student will compose a reflective project report to encapsulate their individual learning and growth throughout this experience. Semester 1 & 2 The module creates opportunities for students to draw on their learning from other modules and apply them to social issues, enabling them to recognize the interplay between social science subjects. The module will ensure topical social issues are raised and analysed from the political, sociological, and legal perspectives. Learners will develop knowledge and understanding of how the policy landscape and other interventions may tackle social issues. They will also complete activities that help them to understand their own aptitudes and learning preferences.

      "Q. What 3M transparency film is recommended for use with my machine? A. 3M has a variety of transparency products available for use in Ink Jet, Laser, Thermal Transfer printers, as well as copiers. The 3M help line can answer questions regarding which product is suitable for use in your particular printer (1-800-328-1371). Also see our compatibility guide . Q. Are there any special steps I need to take to produce a good image through my printer when using 3M transparency films? A. The first step you should take is to consult your printer manual for special instructions when printing on transparencies. Many times the printer driver has a special setting for printing on transparencies. Q. Must I only use the printer manufacturers transparency product when printing, will this void my warranty? A. Some manufacturers may imply this, but 3M guarantees its products to work in the recommended printers and stands firmly behind this guarantee. Q. Why won't my image dry? A. In most cases this is due to feeding the transparency incorrectly. This is easily done, and if you follow these rules, the issue will be resolved: 1. If the transparency is fed from the front of the machine, and exists in the front of the machine, place the transparency imaging side down (textured side), in the media tray. 2. If the transparency is fed from the rear, and exits to the front, place transparency textured side in Media tray facing up, toward the user. 3. If the transparency is fed from the rear, and exits to the rear, place the transparency in the feed tray textured side down, or away from the user. The only other likely reason for the image not to dry is that the incorrect product is being used for that particular printer. Q. Do I print on the textured or smooth side of the transparency? A. The image should always be applied to the textured side of the transparency. Loading instructions on the box will assist in the determination of how your printer feeds transparencies for imaging. Q. How long does the ink take to dry once I've imaged my transparency? A. Ink dry times can vary, and are dependent on the inks used with each printer. Some printers have heaters which assist in drying (consult your printer manual to find out the recommended process for transparency film printing, and if your printer has a heater). It is advised that you allow more time before placing the imaged transparency in a protective sleeve, or if imaging is done under high humidity conditions. Q. What is the difference between CG3460, CG3410, and CG3480? A. Each of these products was designed to perform well with different printers. Each printer manufacturer uses different inks for imaging through their printer. The transparencies have an ink receptive coating which is designed to perform well with these different inks. See the online compatibility guide for products recommended for use with your printer. Q. Can CG3460 be used with a Canon or Epson printer? If not, what will happen if it is? A. CG3460 is designed for best results with Hewlett Packard printers, and a few others. You can image CG3460 on other ink jet printers without damage to the printer, however, the image may not be as good as one with the recommended product for the printer being used. Q. Can I use plain paper copier or laser transparency film with my ink jet printer? A. No, these products are designed to accept images only from a toner based printer or copier. Ink jet transparencies are designed to accept the liquid ink for imaging through ink jet printers. Q. What is the cause of the image looking fuzzy, or the colors mixing together? A. This problem is called bleed . This is one of the major complaints on ink jet transparencies. Make sure you are using the transparency film recommended for your printer. 1. This happens when the inks placed on a coated transparency are unrestricted from spreading when applied. The inks tend to run together, thus giving a poor image, or flow into un-imaged areas giving a fuzzy appearance to the image. Ink jet films are designed to be compatible with certain inks allowing only so much of the ink to flow once it is applied to the surface. 2. Moisture can adversely affect the image quality of ink jet transparencies due to the fact that these films are designed to accept moisture. The inks used are composed of water and other components. The problems begin when moisture from the atmosphere is introduced into the coated surface of the imaged transparency product. This may happen in very humid areas of the world. The result of this is that the moisture combines with the ink and creates too much liquid for the coating on the film to hold, thus bleed may occur. To reduce this occurrence, always store the dry - imaged transparency in contact with a sheet of bond or copier paper. This paper will absorb any excess moisture. Q. What causes banding or clear lines running horizontally through my imaged transparency? A. This is due to the ink jet nozzles being clogged or a lack of flow of the inks in the image. First try cleaning the nozzles with a soft moist tissue, consulting the owner's manual may help. Also, make sure you are using the transparency film recommended for your printer. Q. Where can I purchase A4 size transparency film for my printer? A. A4 size product is normally not available within the US. We can assist in helping you find vendors who can supply you with A4 product, simply contact us at our Customer Care Center. Q. Can you write on a transparency with a transparency marker? A. Not all transparencies are designed for this purpose, however most will accept writing with a marker designed for use with transparencies. There are transparency films designed specifically for this purpose, 3M products AF4300, and AF4309 are such products. Q. Can CG3410 be used with an HP printer? If not, what will happen if it is? A. CG3410 is designed specifically for the printers recommended by 3M. You may try this product with an HP printer without damaging the printer, but the quality may not be as good as with the recommended product for that printer. Q. CG3480 is recommended for my Deskjet color printer, why can't I use CG3460? A. CG3480 is recommended for use when printing is mono - chrome only, it is not recommended for use with color for the Deskjet printers. CG3480 may be used as an alternate, but performance is at a lower level when compared to CG3460. Q. Does 3M sell extended format ink jet transparencies such as 11\" x 17\"? A. There are many divisions within 3M that offer imaging products, and extended formats are available for some applications. The 3M help line is the best source for assistance in finding answers for your needs (1-800-328-1371). Q. What is the difference between Highland and 3M film? A. The only real difference between the two products is that the specifications for manufacture of the products is slightly more relaxed with the Highland brand. It is also possible that there may be a slight defect which will not jeopardize performance with the Highland brand, nor will it be readily evident to the end user. The 3M branded product is manufactured and sold under strict specifications.

It makes sure that your prints are accurate and consistent. There exist a few different ways to calibrate a UV printer while the process will vary depending on the printer model. The best way to calibrate a UV printer is to use a test chart. It can be purchased or created by printing a series of evenly spaced lines and squares on paper sheets. To calibrate the printer, you'll need to measure the spacing and compare it to the correct values. You can then adjust the printer's settings until the measurements match. Another method to calibrate a UV printer is to use a calibration card. This is a piece of plastic or paper that has been pre-printed with a series of test patterns. To calibrate the printer, you will need to measure the spacing and compare it to the correct values. You can then adjust the printer's settings until the measurements match. Whichever method you use, it's important to calibrate your UV printer regularly. This ensures accurate and consistent prints. Use the Appropriate Media for Your UV Printer UV printers need special paper in order to work correctly. The paper is coated in a chemical that reacts when hit with UV light. This is what causes the image to be printed. There are a few different types of UV paper, so it is important to use the correct type for your printer. Optimize Your UV Printer Settings UV printers are becoming increasingly popular due to the high-quality prints they produce. However, getting the best results from a UV printer requires some optimization of the printer settings. Optimization of a UV printer makes the prints crystal clear and better in look. Print a Test Image to Check Your Results Before initiating a large signage printing project, conduct test prints to fine-tune the settings and ensure optimal print quality. Experiment with different color profiles, substrates, and ink settings to find the perfect combination for your specific requirements. Implement a rigorous quality control process to identify any potential issues early on and make necessary adjustments. Regularly inspect the printed output for color accuracy, sharpness, and overall print quality. Select the Right Substrate The choice of substrate plays a crucial role in producing excellent signage prints. Ensure that the substrate is compatible with UV printing and can withstand the curing process without warping or distorting. Opt for substrates specifically designed for UV ink adhesion, such as acrylic, glass, metal, or PVC foam board. Testing different substrates will help you identify the ones that provide the best results in of color vibrancy, adhesion, and durability. Regularly Inspect Proper maintenance is key to the longevity and optimal performance of your UV printer. Keep the print heads clean and unclogged by following the manufacturer's recommended cleaning procedures. Maintain the UV lamp intensity to ensure consistent curing. Check and replace UV filters regularly to maintain print quality. Additionally, regularly inspect and clean the printer's transport system and replace worn parts when necessary. A well-maintained UV printer will deliver high-quality signage prints consistently. Use High-Quality UV Inks Investing in high-quality UV inks is essential for achieving superior print results. Inferior inks can lead to color fading, poor adhesion, or reduced durability. Choose UV inks specifically formulated for signage printing and ensure they are compatible with your printer. Look for inks that offer a wide color gamut, excellent lightfastness, and long-term durability. Using reputable ink brands will help you achieve consistent and vibrant prints that withstand the test of time. Optimize Workflow Efficient workflow management can save time, reduce errors, and optimize the overall printing process. Utilize professional software for design, pre-press, and RIP processes to streamline your workflow. Ensure proper file preparation, including appropriate color profiles and resolution settings. Automate repetitive tasks to minimize human errors and improve productivity. A well-organized workflow will help you optimize time and resources, ultimately leading to high-quality signage prints. Optimize File Preparation Proper file preparation is essential for achieving high-quality signage prints. Start by working with high-resolution images and vector files to ensure sharpness and clarity. Convert your files to the appropriate color space, such as CMYK, to match your printer's capabilities. Pay attention to color profiles and use standardized settings to avoid color inconsistencies. Furthermore, ensure that your files are properly formatted, with sufficient bleed and trim areas, to prevent any issues during the printing process. Maintain Proper Print Head Care The print heads are critical components of a UV printer, and their maintenance is crucial for consistent and high-quality printing. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for cleaning and maintenance. Regularly inspect the print heads for any clogs or damage, and clean them using recommended solutions. Avoid using abrasive materials or aggressive cleaning agents that may harm the print heads. Additionally, ensure that the printer is properly maintained in of ink levels, temperature, and humidity, as these factors can affect the print heads' performance.

      "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS Feature Match: Side Event Playoffs – Ryan Newburn vs. Sorosh Saberian Ryan Newburn finished in third place at the 2009 U.S. National Championship, then went on to represent the United States at the World Championship. His opponent in this match is Sorosh Saberian, fourth place finisher at SHONEN JUMP Championship Toronto. Saberian opened the match with a hand of \"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness,†\"Plaguespreader Zombie,†\"Book of Moon,†\"Dimensional Prison,†and 2 \"Krebons.†He Set Book and ended. Newburn activated \"Charge of the Light Brigade,†sending \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†\"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner,†and another \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" to the Graveyard to search his Deck for another Lumina. He Summoned her, attacked, and Saberian turned her face-down with Book. He Summoned \"Mystic Tomato\" next turn, attacked Lumina, and destroyed her. He Set Prison, Newburn Set a monster, and Saberian drew \"Solemn Judgment.†He Normal Summoned \"Krebons,†attacked with Tomato, and hit into \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter\" – Ryko sent \"Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior,†\"Heavy Storm,†and \"Brain Control\" to destroy \"Dimensional Prison,†and attacked with \"Krebons.†Newburn Special Summoned \"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness,†and a 1200 ATK \"Emissary of Darkness Token.†Saberian Tuned \"Krebons\" to Tomato, Synchro Summoned \"Goyo Guardian,†and Set Solemn. Newburn attacked Goyo Guardan with the Token, activated \"Honest's†effect to destroy \"Goyo Guardian,†then made a direct attack with Gorz. Saberian Summoned \"Krebons,†Newburn discarded \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress\" for \"Solar Recharge,†drew 2, and sent \"Mezuki†and \"Beckoning Light\" to the Graveyard. He Summoned another \"Mezuki†from his hand, removed the Graveyard copy to Special Summon \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†then Tuned it to \"Mezuki†for \"Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier.†Saberian responded with \"Solemn Judgment\" to negate the Summon. Newburn Special Summoned \"Judgment Dragon\"! He cleared the field, attacked, and that was game! Ryan Newburn makes short work of Sorosh Saberian in the first Duel, and the pressure is on! Newburn just had to win one more Duel to score a copy of \"Dark End Dragon.†Saberian would now have to win 2 straight. He opened Duel 2 with \"Solemn Judgment,†\"Call of the Haunted,†\"Creature Swap,†\"Light-Imprisoning Mirror,†\"Torrential Tribute,†and \"Burial From a Different Dimension\" – nothing of use. He Set 3 cards and ended. \"Whatever, I lose to Heavy,†he said. Newburn indeed activated \"Heavy Storm\"! Saberian Chained \"Solemn Judgment,†clearly unhappy. Newburn Summoned \"Jain, Lightsworn Paladin,†lost her to \"Torrential Tribute\" and play was to Saberian. He drew and Summoned \"Zombie Master,†attacked for 1800 damage, and ended. Newburn Summoned \"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner,†discarded \"Necro Gardna\" for her effect, and Saberian Chained \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror\"! Newburn ended, Saberian drew \"Goblin Zombie,†and he Summoned it to attack Lumina. Newburn removed \"Necro Gardna\" to block the attack, Saberian tried to weigh the risk of Newburn having \"Honest\" in-hand to destroy his \"Zombie Master,†and he eventually decided not to attack Lumina. Newburn activated \"Solar Recharge,†discarding Lumina, to draw 2 and send \"Honest\" and \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" to his Graveyard. He Normal Summoned \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress,†attacked \"Goblin Zombie,†and Saberian searched his Deck for \"Mezuki†with Goblin's effect. Lumina attacked \"Zombie Master,†Newburn activated \"Honest,†and Saberian dropped to 2400 Life Points. Newburn Set a Spell or Trap and Saberian activated \"Call of the Haunted\" to bring back \"Zombie Master\" in the End Phase. He pitched \"Mezuki†for \"Lightning Vortex\" next turn, clearing the way for \"Zombie Master\" to attack. Newburn dropped to 4400 Life Points, and in Main Phase 2 Saberian removed \"Mezuki†to Special Summon \"Goblin Zombie\" in Defense Position. Newburn Set a second Spell or Trap with one card left in hand. Saberian had \"Creature Swap,†\"Caius the Shadow Monarch,†and \"Burial From a Different Dimension\" in hand, with \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror,†\"Goblin Zombie,†and \"Zombie Master\" with \"Call of the Haunted\" attached. He attacked with \"Zombie Master\" a third time and Newburn was down to 2600 Life Points. He drew to 2 cards in hand, activated \"Dust Tornado\" to destroy \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror,†then activated \"Charge of the Light Brigade,†sending \"Dust Tornado,†\"Shiny Black \"Câ€,†and \"Necro Gardna\" to the Graveyard to get Lyla from his Deck. He Summoned her, attacked \"Goblin Zombie,†and Saberian got another \"Mezuki†from his Deck. Newburn destroyed \"Call of the Haunted,†and thus \"Zombie Master\" in Main Phase 2 with Lumina's effect. Lyla sent 3 cards to the Graveyard. Saberian drew \"Tragoedia†and began talking himself through his situation: \"It doesn't make sense if that's not a defensive Trap,†he mused, mulling over his opponent's face-down in the Spell & Trap Card Zone. After a bit of thought, Saberian activated \"Burial From a Different Dimension,†sending \"Mezuki†back to his Graveyard. He removed it to bring up \"Zombie Master,†discarded \"Mezuki†to Bring back \"Goblin Zombie,†then tributed it for \"Caius the Shadow Monarch,†removing Newburn's face-down \"Mirror Force\" from play! Saberian had made the right read – Newburn's Set card had indeed been a defensive Trap. \"Zombie Master\" attacked Lyla, Caius attacked, and Newburn removed \"Necro Gardna\" to block the damage. Saberian Set a card to his back row. Newburn passed with 2 cards in hand. Saberian checked Newburn's Graveyard for \"Shiny Black \"Câ€,†verified that there was just one copy, and discarded \"Pyramid Turtle\" for \"Zombie Master's†effect to bring up \"Goblin Zombie\" in Attack Position. He Normal Summoned \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†Tuned it to Caius to Synchro Summon \"Colossal Fighter,†and lost Colossal to Shiny \"Câ€. He then removed \"Mezuki,†brought back \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†Tuned it to \"Zombie Master,†and Synchro Summoned \"Goyo Guardian\"! Newburn only had 2600 Life Points, and by making just one big attack, Saberian eliminated the possibility of being stopped by Gorz. Newburn conceded. Both competitors made use of their Side Decks. Duel 3 began swiftly – the winner of this Duel would take home the \"Dark End Dragon.†Newburn opened with \"Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior\" and a Set Spell or Trap. Saberian had two \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror,†\"Call of the Haunted,†\"Pyramid Turtle,†\"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind,†and \"Zombie Master.†He Set Turtle, Set Mirror, and ended. Newburn flipped \"Heavy Storm,†destroying \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror.†\"Charge of the Light Brigade\" sent 2 copies of \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress\" and \"Plaguespreader Zombie\" to his Graveyard, searching out his third Lyla. He Summoned Lumina, discarded Lyla to Special Summon her, then attacked with her to destroy \"Pyramid Turtle.†Saberian Special Summoned another Turtle in Defense Position and Newburn didn't attack again. A Set card to his back row ended his turn, and he sent a total of 10 cards to his Graveyard – including 2 \"Shiny Black \"Câ€â€ and a Lightsworn with Garoth. Saberian drew \"Tragoedia.†He Normal Summoned \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind,†Tuned it to \"Pyramid Turtle,†and Synchro Summoned \"Black Rose Dragon.†He activated its effect, Newburn Chained \"Beckoning Light,†and took back Lumina, Lyla and \"Honest.†The field was cleared – Newburn would get hammered by that second \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror\" if he tried to use Lumina's effect. Saberian knew that and Set \"Light-Imprisoning Mirror,†feigning weakness. Newburn drew to 4 cards in hand (Saberian had 3), and he Summoned Lyla. He attacked for 1700 damage, tried to use her effect, and Saberian Chained the Mirror. He drew \"Plaguespreader Zombie\" next turn. Saberian Summoned \"Zombie Master,†discarded \"Tragoedia,†Special Summoned \"Pyramid Turtle\" in Defense Position, and Set \"Call of the Haunted.†He sent \"Zombie Master\" into Lyla, Newburn activated \"Honest's†effect, and \"Zombie Master\" was destroyed. The Duel stood at 4600 Life Points to Newburn's 8000. Play was to Newburn. He activated \"Charge of the Light Brigade,†sending \"Wulf, Lightsworn Beast,†\"Judgment Dragon,†and \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter\" to the Graveyard – the Mirror kept Wulf pinned down, and Newburn searched out \"Jain, Lightsworn Paladin.†\"Nice. For me, anyway,†quipped Saberian. Newburn set a card on top of his Deck, Special Summoned \"Plaguespreader Zombie,†and Tuned it to Lyla to Synchro Summon Brionac. He discarded Lumina to bounce \"Pyramid Turtle,†attacked, and Saberian took the 2300 damage, dropping to 2300. Newburn ended. Saberian drew \"Mezukiâ€! He flipped \"Call of the Haunted,†brought back \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind,†and halved Brionac's ATK. He Summoned \"Pyramid Turtle,†attacked over Brionac, and made a direct attack with Gale. Newburn was down to 6650 Life Points. Saberian ended. Newburn Summoned Jain, attacked over Gale, and destroyed it. Newburn ended with one card left in hand. Saberian turned Turtle to Defense Position, Set a monster, Set a Spell or Trap, and ended. Newburn attacked the Set monster – \"Mezuki.†He Set a monster, Set a Spell or Trap and ended. Saberian activated \"Allure of Darkness,†drawing \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer\" and \"Sangan.†He removed \"Sangan,†Normal Summoned Kycoo, and removed \"Mezuki†to Special Summon \"Zombie Master.†\"Zombie Master\" attacked Jain, Newburn flipped \"Mirror Force,†and Kycoo and \"Zombie Master\" were both destroyed! Jain attacked \"Pyramid Turtle,†getting \"Mezuki†in Attack Position. Newburn Set a monster, Saberian drew \"Dimensional Prison,†and Set another Spell or Trap card before attacking \"Necro Gardna\" with \"Mezuki.†Jain attacked \"Mezuki,†was removed by \"Dimensional Prison,†and Newburn had 1 card left in hand with 1 monster Set. Newburn ended. Saberian drew \"Krebons,†Summoned it, attacked with \"Mezuki†into another \"Shiny Black \"Câ€,†and attacked for 1200 with \"Krebons.†Newburn activated \"Charge of the Light Brigade,†sent all of his remaining Lightsworn to his Graveyard, and couldn't get a card as a result. He still had \"Judgment Dragon\" in his Deck. He Set one card to his back row, ended, and took 1200 damage from \"Krebons.†He removed \"Necro Gardna\" to negate \"Mezuki's†attack, and Saberian Set another Spell or Trap card. Newburn activated \"Solar Recharge\" next turn, discarded Celestia for it, drew 2 cards, and sent 2 more to the Graveyard – did he draw \"Judgment Dragon\"? He did! He Special Summoned it in defense as time ticked down, but lost it to \"Bottomless Trap Hole\"! Newburn had one card left in his Deck. Saberian drew, and time was called. Newburn took attacks from \"Krebons\" and \"Mezuki.†Newburn had 1350 Life Points and Saberian at 1800. Newburn conceded next turn! Sorosh Saberian returns to Toronto with a copy of \"Dark End Dragonâ€! Post-Event Analysis! See what our expert had to say about this Duel after the event was over. Michael Kohanim (2009 World Championship Competitor) Sometimes you need to Set a bunch of Spell and Trap Cards and risk your opponent activating \"Heavy Storm.†In the second Duel, Sorosh Saberian Set three cards, fully aware that he would be at a huge disadvantage if Newburn had \"Heavy Storm.†Newburn had it and Saberian was forced to pay 4000 LP to negate it with \"Solemn Judgment.†Although Saberian was displeased with that outcome, I still believe he made the right play. Saberian knew there was a high chance that Newburn didn't have \"Heavy Storm,†which would've left him in great position with his face-down cards. Saberian also knew that even if Newburn did activate \"Heavy Storm,†\"Solemn Judgment†would negate it and keep him in the game.",
      "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS Semi-Finals Feature Match: George Murray vs. Vincent Ralambomiadana Only 4 Duelists remained at this point in the tournament, and whoever won this match would move to the Final Match and was guaranteed a copy of the SHONEN JUMP Championship prize card \"Dark End Dragon.†The other Duelist would play off for third place and a shot at their own \"Dark End Dragon,†but defeat there would mean no prize card. Vincent Ralambomiadana was playing his French Twilight Deck, while George Murray was running Blackwings. Murray opened the match with \"Black Whirlwind†and \"Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame,†searching \"Blackwing – Bora the Spear†from his Deck. He Set a card to his Spell & Trap Card Zone to end. Ralambomiadana had \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress,†\"Heavy Storm,†\"Solar Recharge,†\"Jain, Lightsworn Paladin,†\"Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior,†and \"Honest.†He activated \"Heavy Storm,†destroying Whirlwind and \"Bottomless Trap Hole.†He discarded \"Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior†for \"Solar Recharge,†drew \"Wulf, Lightsworn Beast†and \"Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid,†sending \"Allure of Darkness†and \"Celestia, Lightsworn Angel†to his Graveyard. He Summoned Jain, attacked, and destroyed Shura in battle! In the End Phase he sent Wulf and \"Necro Gardna†to his Graveyard, Special Summoning Wulf – a huge opening turn. Murray Set a monster, Set a card to his back row, and ended. Ralambomiadana attacked next turn, but lost both his monsters to \"Icarus Attack†– Murray Tributed his Set Bora to pull off the move and clear the field. Ralambomiadana Summoned \"Aurkus, Lightsworn Druid†in Main Phase 2, Set a Spell or Trap Card, and sent \"Tragoedia†and \"Plaguespreader Zombie†to his Graveyard in the End Phase. Murray activated \"Heavy Storm,†Ralambomiadana Chained \"Beckoning Light,†and took back \"Honest,†Celestia, and Lyla from his Graveyard. He was now visibly threatening Murray with a Celestia play next turn, protecting Aurkus with \"Honest†if Murray were to attack. Murray Summoned \"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North,†Special Summoned Bora from his Graveyard with Blizzard's effect, then Tuned Blizzard to Bora to Synchro Summon \"Goyo Guardian.†Goyo attacked Aurkus, play proceeded to damage calculation, and \"Honest†boosted Aurkus over \"Goyo Guardian†to destroy it. Murray Set 1 card to his Spell & Trap Card Zone with 1 card left in hand. Ralambomiadana attacked with Aurkus, but lost Aurkus to \"Mirror Force.†Ralambomiadana ended with an empty field. Murray Special Summoned \"Dark Armed Dragon,†held from the previous turn. Dark Armed attacked, Ralambomiadana removed \"Necro Gardna,†and Murray ended. Ralambomiadana removed \"Tragoedia†and Wulf from his Graveyard to Special Summon \"Chaos Sorcerer.†Sorcerer removed \"Dark Armed Dragon†from the field, Ralambomiadana Summoned Lyla, and attacked for 1700 damage. She sent Lumina, \"Necro Gardna,†and \"Beckoning Light†to the Graveyard in Ralambomiadana's End Phase. Murray Set a monster, Set a Spell or Trap, and ended. Lyla's effect blew away his \"Bottomless Trap Hole†next turn, Ralambomiadana Tributed Lyla for Celestia, sent 4 cards to his Graveyard, and destroyed Murray's face-down \"Blackwing – Bora the Spear.†All Ralambomiadana needed to do to win at that point was Special Summon \"Plaguespreader Zombie†to win, but he Summoned his \"Dark Armed Dragon†as well just to make sure he'd get the job done. Vincent Ralambomiadana takes the first Duel with authority, and is just 1 win away from a seat in the finals! Murray got Duel 2 started with \"Black Whirlwind†and \"Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame,†again searching \"Blackwing – Bora the Spear†with his combo. He Set another Spell or Trap to end. Ralambomiadana had 2 \"Solar Recharges,†\"Tragoedia,†\"Charge of the Light Brigade,†\"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner,†and \"Judgment Dragon.†He activated Charge, sent another Recharge, \"Celestia, Lightsworn Angel,†and \"Heavy Storm†to his Graveyard to get \"Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior.†He discarded Garoth for Recharge, drew \"Necro Gardna†and Charge, and sent \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress†and \"Allure of Darkness†to his Graveyard. He activated the next Charge, sent \"Necro Gardna,†\"Royal Decree,†and \"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner†to his Graveyard, then got \"Jain, Lightsworn Paladin.†He Special Summoned \"Judgment Dragon,†but Murray flipped \"Royal Oppression†to negate the Summon! \"Charge of the Light Brigade†discarded Jain for Recharge, drawing Wulf and \"Honest†while sending Charge and \"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness†to the Graveyard. He ended his turn with no field, and Tragoedia in hand. Murray instantly ran the math to calculate Tragoedia's ATK. He Summoned Bora, searched his Deck for \"Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow†with \"Black Whirlwind's†effect, then attacked with Bora for 1700 Battle Damage. He did not attack with Shura, then Set 2 cards to his back row. Ralambomiadana drew Celestia and passed. Bora attacked again, and Ralambomiadana Special Summoned \"Tragoedia†in Defense Position, and it hit the field with 3000 DEF. Shura attacked \"Tragoedia†and Ralambomiadana removed \"Necro Gardna,†fearing that Kalut. He discarded Wulf next turn for \"Tragoedia's†effect, taking control of Shura – a great play that's unique to Ralambomiadana's \"Tragoedia†build of Twilight. He sent Shura to attack Bora, but lost out to Kalut. Murray Normal Summoned Gale, halved \"Tragoedia's†ATK and DEF, then ran it over with Bora for 200 damage. Gale attacked and Murray ended. Ralambomiadana Summoned Lumina, and Murray flipped \"Trap Holeâ€! Ralambomiadana ended with 1800 Life Points. Murray Tuned Gale to Bora, Ralambomiadana paid 800 Life Points to negate the Summon of \"Blackwing Armor Master,†and Murray Summoned \"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North.†He constructed the resulting Chain to keep \"Royal Oppression†from being Chained, but found no targets for Whirlwind's effect in his Graveyard. Still it was game anyways – Ralambomiadana had just 1000 Life Points, and Blizzard struck for game. George Murray uses a clever Chaining tactic and a brutal \"Royal Oppression†in the early game to take the second Duel. We were headed to Duel 3. Ralambomiadana had \"Charge of the Light Brigade,†\"Allure of Darkness,†\"Celestia, Lightsworn Angel,†\"Judgment Dragon,†\"Tragoedia,†and \"Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior.†He activated Charge, sent \"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner,†\"Honest,†and \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress†to his Graveyard, plucking a Lumina from his Deck. He activated Allure, drew \"Necro Gardna†and another Tragoedia, and removed the Tragoedia from the game. He Summoned Lumina, discarded \"Necro Gardna,†brought back Lyla, and sent Charge, Gorz the Emissary of Darkness, \"Heavy Storm,†\"Dark Armed Dragon,†\"Honest,†and another Charge to the Graveyard in his End Phase. Murray Set two cards to his Spell & Trap Card Zone. Ralambomiadana activated Lyla's effect, destroyed \"Torrential Tribute,†and tributed Lyla for Celestia. He sent \"Solar Recharge,†\"Necro Gardna,†Tragoedia, and another \"Necro Gardna†to the Graveyard for Celestia's cost, but Celestia's target was Chained: \"Waboku.†He Set a Spell or Trap, ended his turn, and sent \"Wulf, Lightsworn Beast,†Recharge, and \"Jain, Lightsworn Paladin†to his Graveyard for Lumina's effect. Murray activated \"Black Whirlwind,†Summoned \"Blackwing – Bora the Spear,†and searched \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind†from his Deck. He Special Summoned Gale, activated its effect to halve Celestia's ATK and DEF, then Tuned Gale to Bora to Synchro Summon \"Black Rose Dragonâ€! \"I'm thinking,†announced Ralambomiadana. He Chained \"Beckoning Light,†ditching three cards to return \"Judgment Dragon,†Lyla, and \"Honest†back to his hand. Murray Set two cards to his Spell & Trap Card Zone, Set a third, and ended. He had 1 card remaining in hand. Ralambomiadana drew \"Royal Decreeâ€! He Set it, Murray passed, and Ralambomiadana flipped Decree! Murray had no response. Ralambomiadana Special Summoned \"Judgment Dragon,†paid 1000 Life Points, and destroyed \"Royal Oppression,†\"Waboku,†and \"Trap Holeâ€! Ralambomiadana Summoned \"Honest,†attacked with it, then attacked with the Dragon. Murray had 3900 Life Points left. Ralambomiadana took back his \"Honest,†then sent 2 \"Breaker the Magical Warrior,†Celestia, and \"Chaos Sorcerer†to his Graveyard in the End Phase. Ralambomiadana removed \"Necro Gardna†from his Graveyard in Murray's Draw Phase, preempting the possibility of \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer.†Murray set a card to his back row, lost it to \"Judgment Dragon†next turn (it was \"Bottomless Trap Holeâ€), and Ralambomiadana Summoned \"Honest†again. \"Honest†attacked, \"Judgment Dragon†attacked one more time, and Vincent Ralambomiadana was headed to the Finals! France's 2008 National Champion was now one match away from becoming a SHONEN JUMP Championship winner! Post-Event Analysis! See what our panel of experts had to say about this Duel after the event was over. Michael Kohanim (2009 World Championship Competitor) You may have noticed that even though Ralambomiadana had \"Judgment Dragon†in his hand while Murray had 3 face-down Spell or Trap Cards in Game 3, Ralambomiadana chose not to Summon it. Instead, he Set his \"Royal Decree.†This way, he knew that he would safely be able to Summon \"Judgment Dragon†on his next turn and clear the field with it while \"Royal Decree†was face-up. The concept of holding key cards until you can safely play them is very important in the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. If Ralambomiadana had Summoned his \"Judgment Dragon†as soon as he had drawn it, the Summon would've been negated by Murray's \"Royal Oppression†and Ralambomiadana easily could have lost the Match.

      "LIMITED & FORBIDDEN CARDS Round 7 Feature Match: Steffon Bizzel vs. Paul Squires Both Duelists in this Feature Match have perfect 6-0 records and a great shot at making Day 2. Steffon Bizzell is running a Zombie Deck, and Paul Squires is using Blackwings. This should be a great Match. Bizzell won the die roll and chose to go first. His opening hand consisted of \"Allure of Darkness,†\"Dark Armed Dragon,†\"Bottomless Trap Hole,†\"Armageddon Knight,†and \"Morphing Jar.†He drew \"Destiny Hero – Malicious†as his first draw. He Summoned \"Armageddon Knight†for his opening play and dumped \"Necro Gardna†to his Graveyard with its effect. He Set \"Bottomless Trap Hole†and ended his turn. Squires Summoned Bora on his first turn, and lost it to Bizzell's \"Bottomless Trap Hole.†Squires then Set 1 card and ended his turn. Bizzell top Decked \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind†and activated \"Allure of Darkness.†He drew \"Goblin Zombie†and \"Mystical Space Typhoon.†He removed Malicious from play with \"Allure of Darkness's†effect. Next, Bizzell Normal Summoned \"Goblin Zombie†and attacked with both of his monsters. \"Goblin Zombie†sent \"D.D. Crow†from the top of the Deck to Squire's Graveyard. Squires had 5500 Life Points left. Bizzell Set \"Mysical Space Typhoon†and ended his turn. On his next turn, Squires Summoned \"Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame†and declared an attack on \"Armageddon Knight.†The attack was successful! Bizzell lost 400 Life Points and Shura recruited \"Blackwing – Vayu the Emblem of Honor†from his Deck. In his second Main Phase, Squires Synchro Summoned \"Magical Android†by Tuning Vayu with Shura and Set one more card to his back row. During Squires's End Phase, Bizzell flipped \"Mystical Space Typhoon†to destroy the \"Book of Moon†Squires just Set. On Bizzell's turn he drew \"Mezuki.†He Summoned \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind†and used its effect to halve the ATK of \"Magical Android.†Gale attacked Android and \"Goblin Zombie†attacked directly. Shura was sent to the Graveyard from the top of Squires' Deck and Squires dropped to 4900 Life Points. Bizzell ended his turn. Squires drew for his turn and then Summoned \"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North.†He targeted Shura with its effect. He had 3 cards in his hand, 1 card in his back row, and 2 monsters on his field. Bizzell had 3 cards in his hand with a \"Goblin Zombie†and Gale on the field. Squire declared a Synchro Summon by Tuning Blizzard with Shura and Synchro Summoned \"Blackwing Armed Wing.†He attacked Gale, but the attack was blocked by \"Necro Gardna.†On Bizzell's next turn he drew a \"Book of Life.†First, he used Gale's effect to halve \"Blackwing Armed Wing's†ATK. Then he Tuned Gale to \"Goblin Zombie†to Summon \"Black Rose Dragon†and activated its effect. Squires's Armed Wing and a Set Icarus Attack were destroyed. Bizzell searched his Deck for \"Zombie Master†with the effect of \"Goblin Zombie,†then Summoned it along with \"Dark Armed Dragon.†Squires scooped up his cards, knowing he wouldn't survive the turn. Both players Side Decked and Squires chose to begin Duel 2. He activated 2 copies of \"Black Whirlwind†and Summoned \"Blackwing – Kalut the Moon Shadow.†He searched his deck for \"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North†and \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind†with his two copies of Whirlwind. Then, he Set \"Icarus Attack†and ended his turn. Bizzell opened up with \"Book of Life,†\"Dark Armed Dragon,†\"Soul Exchange,†\"Mezuki,†and \"Mystical Space Typhoon.†He drew \"Torrential Tribute†on his first turn. Bizzell thought for a little while and then activated \"Mystical Space Typhoon†on \"Icarus Attack.†He then Summoned Mezuki and attacked Kalut. Kalut was destroyed and Squires dropped to 7700 Life Points. Bizzell Set 2 cards and ended his turn. On Squires's next turn, he Summoned Blizzard and targeted Kalut. He made Blizzard's effect Chain Link 1, and the effects of Black Whirlwind Chain Links 2 and 3. Bizzell flipped Torrential. \"Mezuki†and Blizzard were destroyed, then Kalut was special Summoned to the field. Squires Set one more card to his back row and ended his turn. On his next turn, Bizzell drew \"Bottomless Trap Hole.†He then flipped his face-down \"Book of Life†and Special Summoned \"Mezuki†from his Graveyard by removing Blizzard from his opponent's Graveyard. \"Mezuki†attacked and Kalut was destroyed. Squires Summoned another Kalut on his next turn, searching for Blizzard and Vayu with the effects of his two \"Black Whirlwinds.†He then Special Summoned Gale and halved the ATK of \"Mezuki.†Kalut attacked \"Mezuki†and Gale attacked directly to drop Bizzell down to 6150 Life Points. It was a rough turn for Bizzell, who was stuck with a \"Bottomless Trap Hole†face-down against Squires's two low attackers. On his next turn, Bizzell drew Necro Gardna. He Set it and ended his turn. Play passed to Squires who activated a third \"Black Whirlwindâ€! He Tributed Kalut for \"Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn.†Bizzell flipped \"Bottomless Trap Hole†to remove Sirocco from play. Gale attacked \"Necro Gardna†and the attack bounced off of it. He halved Gardna's stats in Main Phase 2 by using Gale's effect. Squires ended his turn, Bizzell drew Burial, he Set it, and then he ended his turn too. On Squires' next turn, he used Gale to attack the \"Necro Gardna†with its stats halved, and destroyed it. He ended his turn. He had 3 \"Black Whirlwinds†but no Blackwings to Summon. Bizzell drew \"My Body as a Shield†next turn and ended his turn immediately. On Squires' next turn, he drew and Summoned \"Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer.†Kycoo and Gale attacked, dropping Bizzell to 3050 Life Points and removing all of his monsters from the Graveyard. Bizzell drew \"Brain Control†next turn. He already had \"Dark Armed Dragon,†\"My Body as a Shield,†and \"Soul Exchange,†in his hand. He activated \"Brain Control,†dropped to 2250 Life Points, and gained control of Squires' Gale. He then halved Kycoo's ATK and declared an ATK against him with Gale. Squires used \"Book of Moon†to flip Gale face-down and after Bizzell Set 1 more card in his back row, Squires got his Gale back. Squires used \"Allure of Darkness†next turn to draw 2 cards and remove a Vayu from play. Then he flipped his Gale back face-up and Synchro Summoned \"Blackwing Armor Master†by Tuning Gale with Kycoo. \"Blackwing Armor Master†tried to attack directly, but with \"Necro Gardna†off the field, Bizzell was able to activate \"Burial from a Different Dimension†to return \"Necro Gardna†to his Graveyard and block the attack. In Main Phase 2, Squires Summoned Shura and searched for 3 copies of Bora with his 3 copies of \"Black Whirlwindâ€! Bizzell drew a card and Set a \"Mystic Tomato†next turn. On Squires' turn, he attacked \"Mystic Tomato†with Bora, inflicting 600 damage to Bizzell's Life Points. Bizzell dropped down to 1650 Life Points. Squires searched his Deck for another \"Mystic Tomato†with the effect of his first one and Special Summoned it in Attack Position. Armor Master Attacked \"Mystic Tomato†and Squires dropped Kalut from his hand to seal the game and reduce Bizzell's Life Points to zero. Bizzell would be going first in Duel 3. Side Decking was fast and play began quickly. Bizzell had \"Necro Gardna,†\"Allure of Darkness,†\"Caius the Shadow Monarch,†\"Mystic Tomato,†and \"Trap Dustshoot†in his opening hand. He drew \"Dark Armed Dragon†on his first turn. He activated \"Allure of Darkness†to draw \"Soul Exchange†and \"Heavy Storm,†removing \"Necro Gardna†from play. He Set his Dustshoot along with a Tomato and ended his turn. On Squires's Draw Phase, Bizzell activated Dustshoot! Squires revealed his own Dustshoot, \"Solemn Judgment,†\"Book of Moon,†\"Blackwing – Sirocco the Dawn,†\"Blackwing – Blizzard the Far North,†and Kycoo. Bizzell chose to send Kycoo back to Squires' Deck. In Main Phase 1, Squires Summoned Sirocco and attacked Bizzell's \"Mystic Tomato.†Bizzell searched his Deck for \"Goblin Zombie†with Tomato's effect and Special Summoned it in attack mode. Squires Set 2 cards and ended his turn. During Bizzell's Draw Phase, he activated \"Trap Dustshootâ€! Squires revealed a \"Heavy Storm,†\"Soul Exchange,†\"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter,†\"Caius the Shadow Monarch,†and \"Dark Armed Dragon.†Caius was sent back to his Deck. Bizzell Set his \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter†face-down and ended his turn. \"Man, Heavy and DAD,†Squires said. He sounded a bit disappointed about his current lack of good plays. He thought for a while about his next play and eventually decided to Special Summon Bora to the field. Bora attacked a Defense Position \"Goblin Zombie†and inflicted 650 damage to Bizzell's Life Points. That was the first damage Bizzell had taken. Bizzell searched his Deck for \"Zombie Master†with \"Goblin Zombie's†effect. Squires attacked \"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter†with Siocco next. Bizzell sent \"Necro Gardna,†Mezuki, and \"My Body as a Shield†to the Graveyard with Ryko's effect and destroyed Squires' face-down \"Book of Moon.†Squires acknowledged the three DARK monsters in his opponent's Graveyard, Set a back row card, and ended his turn. He knew what was coming but could do nothing to stop it. Bizzell drew another Soul Exchange next turn. Then he activated \"Heavy Storm†to destroy Squires's Set \"Solemn Judgment,†and then he Summoned \"Dark Armed Dragonâ€! \"Dark Armed Dragon†destroyed Sirocco by removing \"Mystic Tomato†from the game. Next, he Summoned \"Zombie Master†to the field. \"Dark Armed Dragon†attacked Bora and \"Zombie Master†attacked directly. Bizzell Set 2 cards and ended his turn. On his next turn, Squires Normal Summoned Blizzard and Special Summoned Bora from his Graveyard. He tuned his two monsters together for \"Goyo Guardian†and then declared an attack on \"Zombie Master.†Bizzell negated the attack with \"Necro Gardna.†In Main Phase 2, Squires removed Bizzell's \"Goblin Zombie†from the Graveyard with \"D.D. Crow.†On Bizzell's turn, he attacked \"Dark Armed Dragon†into Goyo, destroying them both, and attacked directly with \"Zombie Master.†Squires had no cards on the field or in his hand and activated \"Allure of Darkness.†He drew 2 cards, removed Shura from play and Set a \"Brain Control.†Bizzell activated \"Mystical Space Typhoon†to destroy it in the End Phase. On his next turn, Bizzell drew \"Blackwing – Gale the Whirlwind.†He discarded it with \"Zombie Master†and Special Summoned \"Mezuki†from his Graveyard. With only 3300 Life Points left, Squires scooped up his cards. Some awesome plays made by Bizzell give him a 2-1 win with his Zombie Deck. He's now 7-0 in the tournament, advancing with a perfect record! Post-Event Analysis! See what our expert had to say about this Duel after the event was over. Michael Kohanim (2009 World Championship Competitor) This Match was extremely well-played by Bizzell. I was especially impressed with the way he played the second Duel. Squires started out with 2 copies of \"Black Whirlwind,†which made for a killer opening, but Bizzell managed to hold his own for most of the game. It was a great idea to Set the bluffs that he did throughout the Duel. They could have baited Spell and Trap destruction cards away from the Trap Cards like \"Bottomless Trap Hole†and \"Torrential Tribute†that he needed to protect as long as Squires had 2 copies of \"Black Whirlwind†on the field. to check out the next Feature Match."

As military organizations, communities, and resources become increasingly automated, this agreement with bBIG opens up several new, significant opportunities for Fobi to deliver additional digital solutions to the military market. For example, Fobi's digital verification platform, AltID, can be used to securely verify military membership for each individual and their families, and provide wallet passes as a way to increase the security of shared cards and help prevent identity fraud overall. NEW RESELLER AGREEMENT DRIVES ENHANCED VALUE FOR QPLES ALONGSIDE EXISTING AFFILIATE PARTNERSHIP Qples has an existing business relationship with bBIG as an affiliate partner, with Qples coupons available for print on the agency's exclusive military online savings site, MyMilitarySavings.com. Through the Qples Affiliate Marketing platform, partners like bBIG enable Qples to resell coupon prints through affiliate websites and social platforms, driving additional revenue for Qples through the increased number of coupon prints and clips generated. QPLES RESELLER DEAL WITH bBIG LEADS TO ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT AS A REFERRAL PARTNER FOR PASSCREATOR BY FOBI On February 28th, 2023, Fobi and bBIG signed a referral partnership with the company's Wallet Pass platform, Passcreator. This partnership provides Fobi with a significant opportunity to expand its Passcreator customer base to various bBIG clients and partners. bBIG also aims to use Fobi's digital ID verification solution, AltID, to ensure customers are verified members of the military and their families. Mark Igo, Chief Operating Officer of bBIG Communications, states : \"We are thrilled to announce this new reseller partnership with Qples, having already established a key relationship together as an affiliate partner. As the coupon industry continues to shift toward the 8112 digital format, the Qples platform is helping us better support our CPG brand clients and enhance their promotional offerings to their own customers.\" Rob Anson, CEO of Fobi, states : \"We are very focused on accelerating the expansion of the Qples platform and this signing of our reseller agreement with bBIG is a tremendous win-win. bBIG has a solid 25+ year track record and their list of top-tier clients speaks for itself. The additional Passcreator deal with bBIG also presents a great opportunity for Fobi to potentially deliver more mobile-first platforms and solutions to the U.S. military community, such as our digital verification solution AltID.

      "\"What we enjoy here is just the whole idea of being able to take advantage of everything that's good about San Francisco, being right here in the middle of the city,\" beams Mario Sazo, Dean of Students at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory. \"You're close to the arts, you're close to the ballet, we've got all of these relationships that go on throughout the city.\" It's impossible to deny the magic of Sacred Heart's setting. Perched atop Cathedral Hill, the campus seems to have all of San Francisco under its purview—from awe-inspiring urban cityscapes out of every window, to the 5.6 acre Jefferson Square Park, which sprawls downhill and to the southwest. Founded in 1852, Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory is a diverse urban school with a rich history, and Mr. Sazo has been at its helm for over 16 years. As you might expect from someone with his impressive tenure, Sazo seems to possess a slightly superhuman amount of energy. Positive and quick-witted, his banter with students is self-assured, at times self-depricating, and always met with smiles and laughter from the kids. For as many negative interactions that I could possibly have in this job, I try to make it a point to make sure I have more positive interactions than anything else because… I think that kind of helps in a small way building the community that we have. Happy With PlascoTrac, Happier With Hero Sacred Heart was successful with PlascoTrac. By integrating their discipline system with PowerSchool through PlascoTrac, they built successful programs to check kids into school, track behaviors during the day, and save administrative time not having to manually input behavioral occurrences into their SIS. PlascoTrac helped Mario automate Sacred Heart's discipline programs, but it was tied to one room. Their mobile devices offered some mobility, but for only a few people. As a cloud based solution, Hero offered the potential to take their programs into the classroom, the hallways, and anywhere there is a staff member—while still talking to PowerSchool and doing all of the other things that made PlascoTrac successful at the school. I got a lot more backing when we went from PlascoTrac to Hero, because even the tech director was asking, \"When are they going to go to the cloud?\" With no updates to install, the ability to function from a browser in any computer in the school, and mobile apps for iOS and Android, an upgrade to Hero was much more than a design improvement and some catchy \"cloud app\" jargon—it allowed them to expand throughout the school. We're a big school, and we pride ourselves in being able to track where our kids are at every period. With 1,300 students and a deceptively large campus—in San Francisco, buildings expand skyward out of necessity—Hero gives Mario and his team the power to track behaviors where they happen. And anywhere he is, he can check up on a student in Hero. I always joke with the school president about that—between Hero and PowerSchool, I've got the whole school in my pocket. Free to Innvoate The day we visit Sacred Heart, they're having a blood drive . \"The blood drive used to be a big fiasco for us attendance-wise,\" Mario explains. Not anymore. No computer on a cart to wheel in. The secretary simply shows up with a laptop, checks kids in and out, prints out dress passes for the kids that donate blood, and gets them back off to class. \"It's all one-stop shopping at that point.\" The blood drive is a great way to get kids engaged for a good cause, and it illustrates the flexibility that Hero provides the team at Sacred Heart. With a system that can be anywhere, they can track any program, and reward (or assign consequences to) kids anywhere in the school. More staff are engaged, and more positive programs are possible than ever before. Another new program that Sacred Heart has been able to try with Hero was a wellness program . Knowing that he wanted a way to encourage students to take advantage of Sacred Heart's outstanding fitness center, Mario worked with Hero's support team to set up a program that keeps track of which students are using the fitness center, and for how long. Looking at the data for this school year, Mario boasts that there are only 5 students that haven't checked in to the fitness center . A New Way of Doing Things I tell everybody, we've got these capabilities, don't be afraid to bring your ideas to the table. The switch from PlascoTrac to Hero has been about more than mobility, and even adoption. These things are important, and Mario is excited to start getting Hero into the classroom for school-wide initiatives, but there's a shift more fundamental happening at Sacred Heart—one with the potential for tremendous impact. With Hero, Mario and his team have the freedom to be creative in how they design and deploy new programs like the blood drive and the wellness program whenever they want. In short, they have the opportunity think big. And that means more positive interactions with students, more opportunities to modify behavior—more time spent on things that matter.

      "Fifty or so miles east of downtown Los Angeles lies Santiago High School in Corona, California. In many ways, Santiago is like many suburban-area high schools. They serve a diverse student population, are proud of their 99.7% graduation rate, and offer a multitude of athletics and extracurricular programs. Something else one might expect – and will – find at Santiago High is an exceptionally dedicated group of teachers and staff. Included in this team is Assistant Principal Melissa Bako. Skills for Career & College-Ready Success At just like so many high schools, the Santiago staff is deeply committed to the success of their students. And they know that building career and college ready young adults doesn't begin and end with academics. It's also about teaching students to be responsible and competent citizens. Students need these soft skills, they feel, when entering the workforce or post-secondary education. How is Santiago High doing that? It all comes down to the learning environment. Building Up Students and School Climate To create a schoolwide culture of positivity, staff and teachers use Hero. Initially, the high school implemented Hero to improve student tardiness. When Bako came to Santiago in the fall of 2016, she expanded the tool (which they're using LCAP funding to support) and the school is using Hero's positive reinforcement aspects to support a PBIS framework. Now, the Santiago staff is putting Hero to use to systematically build up and maintain a healthy school climate. Every day, throughout Santiago's classrooms and hallways, administrators, teachers, and support staff recognize the student actions that contribute to a positive school climate. Recognition comes in the form of Hero points, or Shark Bytes as they're called at Santiago, which students earn for being present for office hours, showing responsibility, having integrity, achieving, being respectful, knowing themselves (\"Be a Shark\"), and demonstrating school spirit. Student Incentives That Work Points are instantaneously given and tallied digitally in the Hero app, making the process seamless and hassle-free for teachers. Since students can redeem their points for a variety of rewards, the points have become a real incentive – with students now actively seeking to earn points, says Bako. And they've become contagious as the adult recognition is encouraging positive student actions to spread across campus. \"Be a Shark is becoming common language around campus and in our community. Compared to the 2017-2018 school year, we've tripled the number of Shark Bytes we've rewarded for positive, expected behaviors this past school year,\" Bako adds. Demonstrating School Climate Improvement with Data While many educators struggle with documenting or communicating the way a school environment feels, Santiago is using Hero to measure school climate indicators. By fostering more students to demonstrate expected behaviors and school spirit, they're actively encouraging school connectedness and engagement – key components of school climate. \"By giving Shark Bytes for School Spirit, we've increased the number of students who participate on designated spirit days,\" confirms Bako. Positive Reinforcement for the Student Behaviors that Align with School Climate Logging into the administrator side of Hero allows the school to instantly glance at their data and check on program fidelity – then see how the positive climate is impacting student discipline. \"We are constantly looking at the number of Shark Bytes awarded by week, month, and quarter,\" says Bako. \"We are also seeing a decrease in the number of students seen for minor defiant/disrespectful behavior as recorded in our student management system.\" And to demonstrate climate improvements over time for the district or other stakeholders, the school can use Hero to generate reports that highlight their success. More Time for Learning Another positive the school can communicate is that, partly because of Hero, they've gained back valuable in-class instruction time. Still using the tool to reduce student tardies, Bako says, \"Hero has improved accountability and allowed us to start class right away.\" She reports that \"over the course of 3 and a half years, our unexcused tardies have reduced by 15%.\" Accountability among students is another indicator of climate, and by viewing their Hero program as a whole (tardiness and PBIS efforts together), the school has further evidence climate is improving. They're configured Hero to report tardiness as a \"negative\" behavior, while all the other behaviors they're reinforcing are \"positive\" ones. This produces a quick ratio of positive to negative student/adult interactions, which is instrumental to improving climate. \"We have a 9.3:1 positive to negative ratio,\" explains Bako – which is well beyond the recommended 4:1. Such a high ratio also helps demonstrate teachers have bought-in to the school's initiatives. \"We collect data so that we can course correct as needed and maximize the impact the program has on students and staff,\" Bako says. And at the end of the day, it's helpful to have hard numbers behind all the positivity they feel.

      "When asked how to characterize Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, teachers Jessica Hedley and Kelly McManus beam that students and fellow staff make each day special. \"Everyone works so hard and encourages each other to succeed,\" they say. Located in Charlotte, North Carolina, MLK Jr. is a Title 1 school with a diverse student population. And the story of how they've gotten to the place where they are today, where progress is unfolding daily, isn't your typical \"school improvement\" story. In many ways, MLK Jr. is the kind of school many dream to work at or attend. With the help of strong leadership – \"we have a wonderful principal\" the teachers say – and plenty of community partners, volunteers, and parent involvement, the school is focused on social-emotional learning and academic outcomes. \"We're very big on building leadership within the student population and we've adopted restorative practices,\" they add. Just a few years ago, however, the school did struggle in one area: discipline. According to Hendley and McManus, student tardiness, cell phone misuse, and other Tier 1 behaviors were causing significant disruptions on campus. They're careful not to blame students for the issue, explaining disciplinary issues were rather a consequence of the lack of consistency in the discipline policy. \"Our students are just like all students; they're brilliant. Students thrive with consistency and structure. Both are equally important to creating a safe environment,\" the teachers explain. \"Our students were craving that structure, consistency, and love.\" To bring structure – and to help set behavioral expectations, school leaders turned to Hero. For three years now, the school has been using the student behavior management platform. Hero offers educators a digital way to reinforce or redirect all kinds of student behavior , from tardiness to exhibiting kindness. Redirection usually comes in the form of warnings or other actions, while reinforcement can be done by awarding Hero points. Many schools using Hero opt to reinforce positive student actions by granting positive points whenever a student demonstrates a desired or productive behavior. But Hero is also highly configurable, and MLK Jr. has tailored the tool in an interesting way. MLK Jr. students start the month with a certain number of points in their Hero account. For classroom disruptions, tardiness, absences, cell phone misuse, or other behaviors the school wants to redirect, points are deducted from the student's account. At the end of the month, the students who have kept 90% of their points get access to an exclusive incentive. Incentives vary (to keep student interest up), but they have included talent shows, kickball tournaments, movies, hallway olympics, March Madness events, and guest speakers. Students are also grouped into \"houses\" at the school, and the house class that has kept the most amount of points is awarded a field trip, in addition to monthly incentives. \"Hero allows us to celebrate our students on a regular basis within each classroom, and now, students feel appreciated,\" says Hendley and McManus. \"As educators, it's easy to always notice the 'bad' behavior.\" But by teaching their students behavior expectations, the teachers feel they can actually set students up for success. The structure that the school was looking for has been created with Hero, and students know that they have to follow consistent behavior policies classroom to classroom, schoolwide. \"It's helped my classroom tenfold,\" Hendley says. MLK Jr. administrators are seeing the numerical results that are typical with Hero as well. In the first semester of the 2018-19 school year, for instance, tardies to class decreased by 86%, insubordination decreased by 61%, dress code violations have dropped by 95%, and cell phone misuse decreased by 100%. (These results are one of the reasons they've kept Hero going for three years now.) \"We have less discipline issues in class, and Hero has helped reduced the disciplinary drama,\" the teachers explain. Switching to a digital behavior improvement platform has also made the teachers' lives, and day-to-day school administration, a whole lot easier. \"We always had a dress code policy, but with Hero, it's just easier to monitor,\" Hendley and McManus say. Managing and documenting behaviors is an instant, seamless process now. And the configurability of the platform has been key. \"It's amazing how we were able to easily fit everything around Hero.\" Since administrators and teachers are using Hero, the whole school can work together toward the same goal. \"Our administrators look at reports and the teacher activity within Hero,\" explains the two teachers, and that's helping with program fidelity. Plus, the school is also happy they've met their growth stats for EVAAS data (North Carolina's statewide Educator Effectiveness Model). McManus adds that \"Hero has helped with the retention rate of teachers at our school.\" On the student side, engagement has gone up too, believes Hendley. \"Now that we're using Hero to document student behavior, students can't 'fly under the radar' or 'get lost.' Every student is connecting with someone. Every student knows there's at least one teacher who loves and supports them.\" When MLK Jr. educators have a MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) meeting, they're also turning to Hero. Reviewing student behavior data in the platform is helping to ensure that students are getting the support they need. And for family meetings, the staff is reviewing student behavior records in Hero, \"which has made conversations seamless,\" says Hendley and McManus. \"We don't know how we would get this done if it wasn't documented in Hero.\" At MLK Jr., the reduction in disciplinary incidents, the student engagement, and the other positive changes are huge wins for life on campus. But they're also helping improve school climate, and that's crucial for the final piece in the puzzle: creating a campus where everyone can succeed.
