A single number can now connect any amount of digital elements to create simple, secure and future-proof digital ecosystems around people, entities and things. Unique: The 878TEN number range is a unique Numbering, Naming, Addressing and Identification ecosystem that is both flexible and future-proof. Issued by the UN s International Telecommunication Union (ITU), there is nothing like it now and there is unlikely to be anything like it in the foreseeable future. Universal: 878TEN numbers work simultaneously across the IP world - as Universal Digital Identifiers - and the telephony world - as global mobile telephone numbers. They can be used anywhere and will support any future systems that rely upon digital identity. Ubiquitous: 878TEN numbers are  smart labels  that can be assigned to anything: people, organisations, devices, documents, products, cars, drones, properties, animals - you name it, 878TEN can identify it. Scalable: Ten billion 878TEN numbers are immediately available with the potential to extend the range to one trillion (1,000 billion). Secure: 878TEN uses DNSSEC, the secure form of DNS. It enables world-leading identity verification and integrates with the latest high security Internet technologies such as Blockchain and RINA as well as biometric and biographic identity technologies. 878TEN in the new digital economy: Everyone s digital world is expanding at warp speed. Currently, the only way to connect a diverse digital ecosystem is for each third party independently to hold sensitive personal data, compromising both privacy and security. 878TEN holds virtually no personal data and uses pointers to enable you to simply and securely link your entire digital ecosystem and keep control of your digital world. What s in it for end-users? The beginning of the end of remembering multiple login IDs and passwords. Owning, controlling and potentially monetising your personal data. Low or no cost telephony for the whole world. A simpler, more secure and more trusted Internet experience. Because 878TEN can connect to any digital element, it supports trusted digital relationships by bringing into play world-leading identity technologies, such as multi-factor biometric verification (facial recognition, iris scans, etc.). The user of an 878TEN UDI chooses which data linked to that number is available in the public domain and who can access the private data sets. Dramatic improvements in technology, sensors and networks are fast-tracking the deployment of IoT across the global economy. 878TEN is the world s only Universal Personal Telecommunications range. It is a global number range that is part of the E.164 international telephone number system. Think of +87810 as a country code for the entire planet. Purpose: To make everyone s digital world a simpler, more secure place; where passwords are history and people own and control their personal data. Ambition: To accelerate the trust and growth of the global digital economy and to enable the world s first borderless mobile telephony network. Future: Every person on the planet and billions of connected devices will have 878TEN Universal Digital Identifiers connecting their digital ecosystems. 878TEN supports VISIONng s worldwide deployment and global adoption of the 878TEN number range. 878TEN assists VISIONng with the development and management of the 878TEN ecosystem. 878TEN companies have been established in Australia, the UK and the USA.

We use AI to see, hear and understand how patients respond to treatment. Everyone responds differently to disease and treatment. We are working to understand how. We developed IMA, an interactive medical assistant to assist patients and ensure they receive treatment. IMA aggregates data so you can have access to meaningful clinical insights. Adherence, Retention, Deception, and Digital Biomarkers. Unlocking the potential for new theraphies and benefiting all patients. Our AI interacts with patients We believe that visual and audio data provide the most meaningful insights into patient health. Our platform understands if treatments are working By confirming and optimizing behavior, we are able to determine if the treatment is working. Our data is used to learn and compare These data allow us to understand how drugs perform and how patients respond in clinical research and care. IMA offers new ways of measuring and predicting clinical progress: Expressivity. Treatments save lives Imagine if you could predict their course. Our unique composite measure of engagement assesses individual risk and predicts patient outcome. What does your patient s level of engagement mean? A patient with a high level of engagement. These patients dose consistently and have a high probability of staying in treatment. They respond to targeted interventions and micro-payments. High risk of dropout. Unlike patients who are highly engaged, these patients are inconsistent with their dosing, may be enrolled at poor performing sites or clinics, and are at risk of discontinuing treatment. Deliberate Nonadherence. Some patients who enroll in clinical trials have no intention of taking the drug being tested. AiCure is the first technology to have visual evidence of this behavior in clinical trials. Use our data to target high-risk patients. A global view into site and clinic performance. Data insights can make all the difference. Peer-reviewed publications: Real-word evidence & Cost effectiveness. Clinical Trial Methodology. Built on a foundation of longitudinal patient data.

See our peer-reviewed publications: In drug development, we are defining new methodologies and enrichment strategies Clear value is essential in understanding the application of new technology. AiCure s value is structured around four key pillars: data integrity; lower variability; predictive composite measures; and increases in statistical power. Incorporating these data pillars into study design allows for faster, smaller trials. AiCure is also demonstrating significant results by introducing new trial methodologies such as placebo lead-in periods, micro-reimbursements, and other approaches directly correlated with patient engagement and clinical endpoints. For payors, we are reducing medical costs and waste Medication adherence is one of the few parameters in healthcare that is directly linked to medical costs. AiCure has demonstrated significant savings for some of the largest payors and states by ensuring high-risk patient populations stay on therapy. For science and the healthcare industry, we are developing novel clinical endpoints through computational diagnostics AiCure is pioneering a new set of tools to help researchers and clinicians understand and predict how patients respond to treatment. Advances in artificial intelligence allow computers to capture physiological datapoints that characterize expressivity, psychomotor function, and cognition. Whether a patient has schizophrenia or congestive heart failure, the degree to which they are able to adhere and respond to treatment depends in great part on their mood, their ability to move and to concentrate.

At Aindra, we are building a world where Clinical Pathology is Data driven, Fast and Patient focused. Why? 5.8 billion people. That is the number of people on the planet who today, do not have access to a reliable and high quality healthcare. While inaccessibility is the problem facing the developing world, expensive machines and treatment methods are driving healthcare costs uncomfortably high in the developed countries. And we want to change this broken healthcare system. We at Aindra, are a passionate bunch of technophiles. We re trying to converge the best technologies to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, as it s supposed to be.  Affordable healthcare solutions for all  is our ethos. How? At, Aindra Systems, our goal is to democratise access to quality healthcare, by using deep technology to realise our vision of accessible and affordable healthcare solutions. As technology enthusiasts, we believe the impact of leveraging technologies like Artificial Intelligence in the right way, can deliver more smarter, quicker and reliable systems that will help overcome the existing challenges of the healthcare system. What? Our AI platform Astra, is built to detect critical illnesses such as Cancer. Astra is a powerful platform that can be extended to build detection tools for a number of critical illnesses. As the first beachhead, we have developed a point-of-care detection system for Cervical Cancer that is quick, affordable and accessible. CervAstra will enable women to walk-in to their nearest primary health center, get screened and walk out with their reports. It is that simple. Our intelligent screening system CervAstra, tailwinds the development and striking benefits of computational pathology. Our Technology. Faster diagnosis: Why AI? The biggest reason is because today, multiple factors have converged to create an environment where AI can make discoveries and judgments leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses than humans can perform. It significantly reduces the turnaround time for reports and also enables pathologists to look at only the relevant data. Farther outreach: Healthcare Inclusion. Diagnostic centers are concentrated in the larger cities, whereas most of the population resides in smaller cities or villages. Our compact systems are portable that can be carried to the point- of care. Our technology enables the healthcare system to extend itself into the far reaches of any country. Increased throughput: Fatigued and limited pathologists, cause a delay in reports, and increase the number of misdiagnoses leading to enormous social & economic costs. There is also an shortage of specialists at many medical institutions. There is a need for an AI imaging diagnosis support system that can interpret images, detect small lesions that even specialists could miss. AI eliminates the grunt work of looking at 80% normal samples. Feedback learning: Through intelligent architecting of the system, the AI algorithms are continuously learning from human intervention when Pathologists either confirm or reject the findings of the algorithms. These are then automatically redirected back as feedback, to build even better Deep Learning models. If data is the life blood of any Deep Learning system, our system ensures that there is a constant supply of supervised data that goes into building better models.",,,,

This is how we do it. 10x-15x ROI According to Customer-Provided Estimates With implementations with tier-one financial institutions worldwide, BioCatch behavioral biometrics has proven to deliver tremendous returns on investment once deployed. Traditional fraud prevention tools fall short of addressing the sophisticated methods that fraudsters are employing today. In fact, most fraud today comes either from using synthetic or stolen IDs or after the login. As a result, the savings attributed to BioCatch may reach millions of dollars per month, with very high fraud detection performance rates. As impressive as these values are, they represent only part of the big picture. Other less-quantifiable value dimensions such as user satisfaction and preventing user abandonment by minimizing false positives are just as significant, if not more. Using well-established methodologies that look at actual fraud savings as well as operational savings due to fewer escalations and step up authentication protocols, business line managers, fraud prevention departments and information security officers can apply a predictable and rational model for the best way to apply behavioral biometrics in their organizations. The value quantification process can be utilized at any organization not only to assess the actual business value for behavioral biometrics, but also to optimize the set of fraud detection solutions deployed, the set-up, and their threshold settings. In addition to tremendous savings, behavioral biometrics may also accelerate the deployment of new applications and offerings, reduce risk, increase management confidence and create new growth opportunities.

OUR STORY BioCatch was founded in 2011 by experts in neural science research, machine learning and cybersecurity. Today we re redefining digital identity and enabling secure and seamless online experiences through innovation in AI-driven behavioral biometrics. The Leader in AI-Driven Behavioral Biometrics BioCatch was founded in 2011 by experts in neural science, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and cyberterrorism. The newly-founded company had a significant mission: to address next-generation digital identity challenges by focusing on online user behavior rather than static authentication measures, like passwords or endpoint security. They discovered an untapped goldmine. Powerful behavioral insights ‚Äî gleaned from the analysis of more than 2,000 physical and cognitive behavioral parameters ‚Äî were able to support different use cases across the digital identity lifecycle. The technology enabled the holy grail of the modern digital era ‚Äî seamless and secure online experiences. Behavioral biometrics, a technology used to identify people based on their behavioral parameters, was born. BioCatch founder Avi Turgeman began pursuing a theory that people interact with machines in unique, measurable ways while serving in military intelligence. Drawing on years of experience exploring white-hat hacking, system vulnerability management and cyberterrorist operations, Turgeman turned his attention to online fraudsters and their identifiable signatures, co-founding BioCatch with Benny Rosenbaum. In developing their AI-driven platform to passively identify both human and non-human behaviors online, BioCatch upended the paradigm of having to choose between security and convenience. Today, the company continues its commitment to innovation through an unparalleled IP portfolio of more than 60 granted or pending patents. The BioCatch platform is deployed by major banks and other global enterprises to help manage their digital identity challenges. The technology prevents new account fraud, authenticates online users, prevents account takeover fraud and detects vishing scams, generating impressive returns on investment that come from catching more fraud as well as reducing false positives and unnecessary escalations.

Founded in 2002 it has developed a variety of solutions and built customer references in large-scale identification projects. Its management team, representing over 20 years of experience in developing and implementing biometrics-based technology solutions across vertical markets, focuses the company on identity solutions that match specific customer requirements rather than championing any individual technology. BioID Projects BioID Technologies markets its solutions to Government (Immigration and Public Safety), Aviation / Transportation and Financial Services. The company recognizes the following market requirements driving implementation in these markets: 1.Scalable identification performance 2.User convenience 3.Modular architectures that allow for flexibility in deploying individual biometric and security technologies. 4.Return on Investment, as the key parameter in any business case, is the single most important driver in biometric market development. Hajj Project Pilgrims (KSA) Having successfully completed the first large-scale Iris Identification project at the Hajj Airport for Pilgrims on their yearly visit to Mecca in early 2002, BioID Technologies is successfully extending that experience to further Airports (Border Control) where rapid enrollment and (token-less) identification is key. UNHCR Refugee Identification System Working with the United Nations in Geneva (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and in cooperation with Iridian Technologies, BioID developed a Refugee Identification System for the UNHCR operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2002. Its purpose is to prevent refugee from applying multiple times for UNHCR travel assistance. By developing and implementing an anonymous Iris Recognition enrollment application, individuals that apply twice (recyclers) are identified within seconds without the need of tokens or ID documents. The project is operational covering multiple sites across Pakistan and Afghanistan and with more than 950,000 individuals enrolled it constitutes the larges Iris Recognition implementation to date and be expanded to 1.000,000 individuals during the course of 2006. UNDP Registration System DR Congo In 2004 BioID implemented a turnkey registration system for UNCP in DR Congo. In order to carry out the registration, identification and subsequent data management, UNDP has implemented a biometric registration and identification system combined with an ID card issue and database management component and central database for registering 20.000 ex-combatants in Five Transit Sites in the region of Ituri (north-east of DRC). The pilot was extended to a rollout across 23 sites in Congo during 2005 and 2006 with currently 140 000 individuals enrolled. BioID has provided UNDP a turnkey solution including the design, development and installation of the DDR Registration System. BioID is provides an integrated system: 1.Register ex-combatants with Iris Recognition 2.Identify individuals based on Iris Recognition 3.Input and manage personal records 4.Personalize and print  ID cards 5.Manage transactional information related to benefits distribution 6.Provide a management reporting function Afghan Civil and Voter Registration Pilot Project The CVR project was a component of UNDP Enhancing Legal and Electoral Capacity for Tomorrow (ELECT) Project to provide support to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) of Afghanistan in becoming a fiscally and institutionally sustainable administration with high integrity, capacity and resources to undertake elections in an increasingly fiscally sustainable manner by end-2008. For maximum utility of resources, a Joint Civil and Voter Registry project will produce an accurate and comprehensive national database of all its citizens. The national database will be used to produce and issue a national Identify document to all Afghan citizens that will serve as proof of identity. The national database and ID will serve multiple government departments will the government of Afghanistan eliminate various forms of identity fraud. The solution developed for the UNDP Afghan CVR project is based on a hybrid biometric system using iris recognition as well as face recognition systems.",,,,

OUR STORY: In 2013 while studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Bocholt, Germany the question was raised whether there was an indoor positioning system existent or not. After discussing advantages of such a system, we concluded that there was no system available because GPS usually isn t working indoors. I personally kept thinking about it and how to commercialise such an idea. Then, in 2015 at the University of Queensland I stumbled across a laser technology which was used to automate flying drones. From the very first second, I was taken back to the time when we discussed the indoor positioning system a few years ago. I started looking into vision technologies and created a minimum viable product (MVP) in 2016. Throughout the past 12 months we have discovered various use cases for vision technologies in factories, warehouses, and retail.

163,BrainChip Holdings Ltd.,Australia,2013,Public,1,1,1,1,1,0,https://www.brainchipinc.com/,,,"BrainChip is the leading provider of neuromorphic computing solutions, a type of artificial intelligence that is inspired by the biology of the human neuron - spiking neural networks. Our spiking neural network technology can learn autonomously, evolve and associate information just like the human brain. We have recently unveiled the Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip. Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip The AkidaTM NSoC is both low cost and low power, making it ideal for edge applications such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous vehicles, drones, vision-guided robotics, surveillance and machine vision systems. Its scalability allows users to connect many Akida devices together to perform complex neural network training and inference for cybersecurity and financial technology (FinTech) applications. Biologically Inspired, Digitally Engineered. The Akida NSoC is the first in a revolutionary new breed of neuromorphic computing devices. Inspired by the biological function of neurons but engineered on a digital logic process, these spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inherently lower power than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). SNN replace the math-intensive convolutions and back-propagation training methods of CNNs with neuron functions and feed-forward training methodologies. BrainChip s research has determined the optimal neuron model and training methods, bringing unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. Each Akida NSoC has effectively 1.2 million neurons and 10 billion synapses, representing 100 times better efficiency than neuromorphic test chips from Intel and IBM. Comparisons to leading CNN accelerator devices show similar performance gains of an order of magnitude better images/second/watt running industry standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 with comparable accuracy. BrainChip Studio and Accelerator BrainChip Studio and BrainChip Accelerator utilize our neuromorphic computing technology to provide video analytics solutions for law enforcement and intelligence organizations. Because it rapidly learns new objects, patterns, and faces, it can quickly search vast amounts of video footage for previously unknown suspects. BrainChip Studio aids law enforcement and intelligence organizations to rapidly search vast amounts of video footage and identify patterns or faces. A result of over 10 years of R&D, it uses an artificial intelligence (AI) technology called a spiking neural network (SNN), a type of neuromorphic computing that simulates the functionality of the human visual tract. Because faces have unique identifying features, the software includes advanced facial detection, extraction and classification algorithms. The SNN technology enables BrainChip Studio to work on low-resolution video and requires only a 24x24 pixel image to detect and classify faces. BrainChip Studio runs on standard x86-based desktop and server platforms with most common video file formats. It is currently available to select law enforcement and intelligence agencies. BrainChip Accelerator is an 8-lane, PCI-Express add-in card that increases the speed and accuracy of the object recognition function of BrainChip Studio software by up to six times. It does this by accelerating video scaling, spike generation, and spiking neuron model comparisons. In combination with a CPU that has 16 virtual cores, BrainChip Accelerator can process 16 channels of video simultaneously, with an effective throughput of over 600 frames per second. The low-power characteristics of BrainChip s spiking neural technology results in a power-sipping 15 watts total consumption. This results in a lower total cost of ownership compared to using additional servers. The Akida Development Environment The AkidaTM Development Environment is a complete machine learning framework for the Revolutionary Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NSoC). The AkidaTM Development Environment is a complete machine learning framework for the creation, training, and testing of spiking neural networks (SNNs), supporting the development of systems for edge and enterprise products on the Company s Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NSoC). The Akida Development Environment includes the Akida Execution Engine, data-to-spike converters, and a model zoo of pre-created spiking neural network (SNN) models. The framework leverages the Python scripting language and its associated tools and libraries, including Jupyter notebooks, NumPy and Matplotlib. Akida Execution Engine The Akida Execution Engine is at the center of the framework and contains a software simulation of the Akida neuron, synapses, and the multiple supported training methodologies. Easily accessed through API calls in a Python script, users can specify their neural network topologies, training method, and datasets for execution. Based on the structure of the Akida neuron, the execution engine supports multiple training methods, including unsupervised training and unsupervised training with a labelled final layer. Data to Spike Converters Spiking neural networks work on spike patterns. The development environment natively accepts spiking data created by Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). However, there are many other types of data that can be used with SNNs. Embedded in the Akida Execution Engine are data-to-spike converters, which convert common data formats such as image information (pixels) into the spikes required for an SNN. The development environment will initially ship with a pixel-to-spike data converter, to be followed by converters for audio and big data requirements in cybersecurity, financial information and the Internet-of-Things data. Users are also able to create their own proprietary data to spike converters to be used within the development environment. A Large Addressable Market BrainChip s artificial intelligence technology is inherently low-power, quickly trained, and works in challenging environments. Because our technology is trained, not explicitly programmed, it can be used in a variety of applications. Vision Systems The Akida NSoC can be used in any embedded vision system for object recognition. Applications include ADAS/AV, drones, vision guided robotics, and machine vision. Cybersecurity In cybersecurity applications, the Akida NSoC is a powerful accelerator for packet inspection, malware, and anomaly detection. Financial Technology Using an innovative unsupervised learning methodology, the Akida NSoC can perform clustering to find patterns in large amounts of unlabeled financial data. Civil Surveillance: Forensic Object Search and Facial Classification BrainChip Studio and BrainChip Accelerator helps law enforcement and intelligence organizations to rapidly search vast amounts of video footage and identify patterns. BrainChip Studio includes advanced facial detection, extraction and classification algorithms. The spiking neural network technology enables BrainChip Studio to work on low-resolution video, and requires only a 24x24 pixel image to detect and classify faces. Casino Solutions BrainChip has created a custom card and chip recognition system with its partner Gaming Partners International. The accuracy of the system is unparalleled, with over 99% accuracy rate. Limitless Application Possibilities Our technology is not application specific, but a core enabling technology for neuromorphic computing. Because it is low-power, our technology can be used in nearly any embedded system. Beyond the previously described applications, neuromoprhic computing can be used in potentially unlimited applications such as smartphones, speech recognition, the Internet of Things (IoT), and agricultural technology among others. A Technology that Learns Like the Human Brain - Neuromorphic Computing BrainChip s technology uses a type of neuromorphic computing called spiking neural networks (SNNs). It has many attractive characteristics, including the ability to be trained rapidly, high accuracy and low compute overhead. This is an important feature in the world outside of the internet, where massive datasets are not available. For instance, a police department looking for a suspect in live video streams does not have thousands of images of that suspect, nor does it have weeks to train a traditional convolutional neural network system. What Makes Our Technology So Exciting Our technology learns from experience, autonomously, just like a human. Deep Learning networks are power-hungry and require large GPU-Server clusters and weeks of training. BrainChip s SNNs can learn in an unsupervised manner, without large datasets, and finds patterns that humans may not be aware of. This rapid learning capability opens up new possibilities to find objects in video, patterns in large datasets, and hundreds of other applications. Because SNNs can be implemented using regular logic functions, they are inherently high-performance and low-power. How It Works Spiking neural networks are inherently feed-forward networks, for both training and inference. Our neuron models learn through selective reinforcement or inhibition of synaptic connections and programmable firing thresholds. Ingrained in these models are innovative training methodologies for supervised and unsupervised training. In the supervised mode, the initial layers of the network train themselves autonomously, while in the final fully-connected layers, labels can be applied, enabling these networks to function as classification networks. The Akida NSoC is designed to perform either on-chip training or off-chip training in the Akida Development Environment. A Leader in Neuromorphic Computing Neuromorphic computing is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the functionality of the human neuron. At BrainChip, we have developed a revolutionary spiking neural network (SNN) technology, a type of neuromorphic computing that learns autonomously, evolves and associates information just like the human brain. BrainChip s first application of this technology is the award-winning BrainChip Studio and BrainChip Accelerator, which aids law enforcement and intelligence organizations to rapidly search vast amounts of video footage and identify objects or faces. The Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NSoC) is the first in a new breed of neuromorphic computing chips that puts artificial intelligence at the edge and the enterprise.",,,,

170,Cainthus,Ireland,2015,Private,1,0,0,1,0,0,https://www.cainthus.com,,,"THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION IN AGRICULTURE IS HERE. At Cainthus we are working hand in hand with farmers to develop the world s most advanced technology for dairy farms today. Technology that s transformational for animals, farmers and the production of food. Using computer vision and artificial intelligence, our smart cameras observe nutritional, behavioural, health and environmental activities that can impact production. We translate this visual information into actionable insights that enable the farmer to make data-driven decisions to improve farm operations and animal health. ANIMAL BENEFITS. Cows are clear communicators if we know what to look for. Comfort is central to the health and well-being of dairy cows, and though they may not have the ability to speak, they give out clear signals that we can observe and alert the farmer to if intervention is needed, ensuring their comfort is always top priority. FARMER BENEFITS.  I want to manage every cow like it s my only cow . As farms continue to consolidate, labor shortages increase and herd sizes grow, more and more farmers are turning to technology to help them watch over their business. ALUS watches 24/7 so you don t have to. FOOD PRODUCTION BENEFITS. ""Consumers have never cared more or known less about where their food comes from"" ‚Äì Jack Bobo. Transparency in the supply chain from farm to fork is key to consumer confidence, and the ability to observe cow comfort 24/7 means the consumer need not have any welfare concerns relating to how their food is produced. Our vision, your success. At Cainthus our vision is for a world of sustainable abundance. By providing meaningful measurement for food production and animal well-being on-farm, we believe this can lead to a better life for all. We are a computer vision and artificial intelligence company based in Dublin, California and Ottawa. We combine unparalleled expertize and cutting-edge innovation, to passively monitor your cows 24/7 and analyze their well-being, productivity and performance, alerting you when it matters most. Farmers First: Although Cainthus roots are steeped in agriculture, we know that farmers today have the benefit of hindsight when it comes to herd management, and it s this knowledge, passed down from generation to generation, that is the key to turning hindsight into foresight. Our Story: Coming from a small village in rural Ireland and growing up in a family that owns Ireland s largest grain importer and exporter, Comex McKinnon, David and Ross Hunt have a rich background in agriculture. Post college, Ross worked in accounting before he entered the family business while David initially pursued a career in corporate banking. Despite his success in the sector, he found it to be an unsatisfying profession and after five years decided to close the book on his banking career. Our Team: Building effective teams with the right attitude emanates from the highest levels of an organization. At Cainthus we operate with a spirit of openness and collaboration, spearheaded by our leadership. Teams are not born, they are built, and team spirit comes from the top. An eye on your farm, an eye on your future. Technology in one form, or another has existed on dairy farms for many years and farmers are a very  tech-savvy  group when it comes to understanding the benefits data-driven decisions can make to their operations. Combining computer vision and artificial intelligence. At Cainthus we are building a computer vision (CV) enabled product that can be installed on dairy farms. We combine CV and deep learning to monitor animal behavior as well as operations on the farm. Our smart camera system has the ability to make observations 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we build intelligence into that monitoring, similar to a humans ability to watch what is happening. System features allow the farmer to do things like set an alert for changes to the farm management plan, and then we can do trend analyses to understand where there is room for improvement. Our easy-to-use software delivers daily notifications to your phone or computer and provides access to detailed analytics that can inform the actions you need to take to improve milk production and animal well-being.",,,,

Supporting responsible gaming and safe casinos Casinos worldwide are using real-time face recognition to alert security staff of banned persons, and of patrons enrolled in voluntary exclusion programs who have asked to be stopped at the entrance. High rollers can receive special treatment as they are recognized at the entrance. Gaming facilities can use facial analysis for an initial age check to avoid paying high fines for underage visitors. The software also detects gamblers who are staying too long in the casino, or within a certain area of the gaming floor. Alerting retail staff to shoplifters, minors, and valued customers Retailers use face recognition to support their security measures, while providing more personalized shopping experiences. A database with persons of interest‚Äîwhether you stop them from entering or greet them in person‚Äîcan be shared among multiple stores. Curtail underage sales violations, and avoid fine payments and license revocations! Anonymous facial analysis computes visitor statistics, e.g., footfall during peak times, or in certain areas of the store. Use visitor data for staffing and other operational decisions! Analyzing guest footfall, visit length and frequency Restaurants want to know more about guest count and behaviour, and can use anonymous facial analysis to collect precise data about when, how often and for which duration guests visit their premises. Restaurant chains can determine if patrons frequent various locations. In addition, restaurant businesses could allow customers to self-enroll in a valued guest database, and then recognize and greet them upon entry. Another gallery may collect images of persons who are banned from entering the premises. Posting instant watch list alerts, and managing people flow Face recognition adds another security layer to border control and airport security procedures by checking watch lists in real time and providing instant notifications when a known person is seen by a camera. FaceVACS-VideoScan can detect crowds and measure waiting times in specific areas to prompt the redirection of people traffic. Airports also use the technology to assess journey times through the airport, using the data to change airport design, and evaluate staff and process performance. Preventing disruption, injury, and destruction of property Adding cameras along with a face recognition system to stadium entrances complements other security measures to keep criminals and violent fans from entering the event facility. Event management can use statistical information derived from facial analysis to measure visitor counts and distribution, and use footfall data and person demographics to evaluate past and plan future events.Greeting customers with more than a smile Banks can recognize their customer upon entry and greet them by name and with their account details at hand. Daily reports about customer count and frequency supports planning for staff resources and branch capacities. In the long run, banks can use such statistics to inform future business strategies.

Hi, I m Dr. Kenneth Yeh, Pediatrician & Cubo AI s medical consultant. For me, everything started when I began noticing how many parents asked me about making sure babies sleep safely at night. There s a lot to be said about sleep safety, but the best advice I could give was that babies should be laid to sleep on their backs. Given newborns can spend an entire day sleeping, it s incredibly important that they sleep in the correct posture and that parents employ safe sleeping practices. I was really excited when Cubo AI team reached out to me! We made a good team because we had a common goal of keeping babies safe. I provided professional medical guidance and Cubo AI worked on the technology. Sleep Safety: Our Common Goal. The World s First Smart Parenting Assistant. A baby monitor that is created by parents and designed for babies. 93% of 6182 parents reported better peace of mind. We spent more than a year carrying out over 8000 questionnaires and 158 in-depth interviews to understand what parents wanted. After extensive testing and iterations of various prototypes, we finally arrived at Cubo AI: the world s smartest AI Baby Monitor. Cubo AI s development hasn t just been one team s effort, it is a culmination of the experience and expectations of parents globally. Our common goal: helping babies everywhere grow up safely. It all began in 2017 when a team of parents and experts in AI, hardware and software with over 15 years collective experience came together with the common goal of helping to protect babies everywhere grow up safely.

FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE: AUREUS 3D-AI DELIVERS FAST, ACCURATE, SCALABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE In 1966 a mathematician and computer scientist named Woody Bledsoe was assigned by a US intelligence agency to find a way for a computer to utilize facial recognition. The problem was, given a large database of images (a book of mug shots) and a photograph (another mug-shot), it was challenging to determine a match. Fifty years later, facial recognition still refers to a computer system that matches two images of faces. The difference is we re now searching databases scaling to hundreds of millions of images, and the ""photograph ""is now a live video stream. CyberExtruder approaches the problem of matching faces from a vastly different perspective ‚Äì3 dimensions (3D).

CyberExtruder excels at understanding customer goals and co-operatively working to bring the clients  vision to life. FORENSIC ANALYSIS AND FACE RECOGNITION Law enforcement and intelligence agents frequently must analyze video as part of forensic analysis when investigating criminal activity. In the past, low-resolution video cameras combined with the need for identification matches to be made manually relegated video evidence to a role of being slow and time-consuming. Aureus 3Df is the worlds fastest facial recognition software. FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY Every conversation about facial recognition begins with  How accurate is it?  and this is just not a simple question to answer. There are multiple factors and multiple variables within each use case which will impact the answer to the question. Fortunately, CyberExtruder has approached the challenge of biometric-based face matching in a very different way than everyone else. The cornerstone of this is our patented 2D to 3D transformational process which mitigates a lot of the variables that can negatively impact matching scores. Then layer in our proprietary deep convolutional neural networks, and the result is a face matching system which is uniquely fast and accurate by design, flexible in use and scalable for tomorrow because what we can uncover about a face as it transforms from 2D to 3D allows us to solve problems no one has yet considered. Facial recognition search performed on video presents levels of difficulty not seen in controlled environments because subjects may be absent for extended periods, with cluttered backgrounds yielding false face detections in other algorithms. Subjects are not only in motion, but the direction they are moving is not optimal for face matching purposes. Motion can cause blurring which means that to be effective, algorithms have to track faces through time. This task is further complicated by busy backgrounds, variations in lighting and the possibility of faces being hidden (occluded) by objects or other people. Now add in the likelihood of multiple people being present in a scene each one requiring simultaneous detection, tracking, and matching.  Facial detail is degraded due to the lossy compression that is present in almost all video transmission and storage. Our answer to all these challenges is Aureus 3D and CyberExtruder s continuing program of research and development in advanced facial recognition (FR) technologies. We believe we have developed the world s fastest and most accurate face matching engine. Our performance superiority is based on our proprietary 2D to 3D face modeling technology which mitigates the challenges of pose, lighting, and expression as well as our use of convolutional neural networks which allow us to train our algorithms to deliver ever increasing performance. But it s not just about being the best at matching faces. Our approach optimizes the competitive difference of 3D over 2D technology and delivers real-time face matching is full frame rate video. Our 3D technology compensates for the pose, lighting, facial expressions, and vague images ‚Äì which are the biggest constraints to conventional FR. Our 3D technology works with any video camera, and we provide the most accurate face tracking technology anywhere. Best of all, our software is designed for easy partner integration.",https://cyberextruder.com/,230,4/7/00,10/7/25

THE NOTION THAT CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE PERTINENT THAN IT IS TODAY. OUR STORY. People and time: the new dynamic This is a moment in history when our most precious resource, time, is undergoing ceaseless attacks. A moment when an elemental change in how people interact with each other and new technology isn t merely a nice-to-have, but a must-have. Just look at the numbers. People exchange more than 100 trillion messages annually. Professionals spend half of their days just on email and internal knowledge management, constantly juggling applications, systems, and devices. Then there are the 4 million apps available for download and the 200 billion smart machines projected by 2020. The world is drowning in data yet 96% of organizations are failing to capture true value from it. The only thing not growing is the time we have to make sense of it all. Advanced machine intelligence is a powerful solution to today s prevailing technology headwinds. People and organizations alike struggle with productivity every day as constant distraction chips away at our time and attention. Cybersecurity threats are more numerous and costly than ever. And information overload leaves us searching for the meaning and context hidden under oceans of data. Entefy is addressing these challenges to personal and organizational productivity. Our advanced AI and communication solutions return each of us to the centers of our digital worlds. We re solving the information overload problem with next-gen machine intelligence that enables fast access to information that really matters. And we ve engineered patented technologies to give people and companies secure command over their valuable data. In the Entefy future, everyone achieves their full potential using machine intelligence that amplifies effectiveness and creativity in unprecedented ways. Gaining us more time to discover and do more. Impact first. Everything else will follow. This is a foundational concept at Entefy. If we re going to spend time solving problems, make them the biggest hardest problems out there. Form and function Select a meaningful problem. Recruit an exceptional team. Focus on real solutions. Change people s lives. We believe that if we are going to spend time solving problems, we should make them the biggest, toughest problems we can find. Entefy helps people and organizations DiscoveR&Do more. Our team has engineered patented technologies in communication, machine intelligence, and cybersecurity that transform interactions between people, smart machines, and services. Our solutions enable next-generation collaboration, search, knowledge management, data intelligence, and AI assistance‚Äîaccelerating digital transformation to fuel growth and productivity in unprecedented ways. How do we know we ve made an impact? Using a yardstick of firsts-mosts-bests that measures success. This is how the four Forces concept arose. Big organizations need to be hierarchical because they have many specialized silos. Entefy is a different creature. At this stage, we optimize for speed, precision, and efficiency. Product Force brings the Entefy technology platform to life, Growth Force engages with customers, Talent Force ensures we have the right skills and cultural values within our team, and Business Force makes everything run smoothly. It is an entirely new way to organize a company to ensure continuous innovation. Our mission: To save you time so you can live and work better. The infinitude of human potential: 1 INNOVATION The stories of humankind s most remarkable thinkers show that more than mere necessity drives innovation. Courageous innovation is that rare breed of innovation born in environments fraught with obstacles and yet still succeeds for the benefit of all. 2 DRIVE Persistence. Grit. Moxie. Call it what you want, you know it when you see it. Drive defines that rare person with a vision to upend a paradigm or improve the understanding of the world. 3 CURIOSITY The Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman was renowned for the breadth of his interests. He said in his autobiography, ""I m always looking, like a child, for the wonders I know I m going to find."" 4 TRUST The causeway that links one person to another is trust. We see trust in the commitment of a handshake, and in fidelity to people we never meet. Many of us engage in a collaborative exercise in trust every day: the commute. 5 AGILITY Generating innovation when technology is always changing, when our understanding of the world is always changing, requires mental flexibility to rival the physicality of a ballerina or the power of a sports legend. TEAM: 10X talent that runs deep. Culture. Renaissance team. Diversity. Small team. Big impact.

Today, we service the largest needs in the industry. That said, our philosophy of taking care of our own ‚Äì partners and employees ‚Äì is the foundation of our success. Examity entered the online proctoring market in 2013. At the time, there were a number of providers already in the space, but each was offering a single-service style solution, e.g. auto proctoring. As we met and connected with university, certification, licensure, and pre-employment partners, we realized that a new online proctoring approach was required. We developed our solution to encompass a variety of proctoring styles, from automated through to live. In addition, we heard time and again that test-takers require immediate, and ongoing support, on their schedule. With this in mind, we built our team (now 500 strong, across 4 times zones) to provide students with 24/7 support, through familiar and accessible channels. Since 2013, we are both excited and honored to have experienced more than 50% growth, every year we have been in business. This is a validation of our success. We take great pride in our ability to handle more than 1 million assessments per year. We maintain partnerships with more than 500 enterprise testing organizations, corporations and universities. Notable partners include: Amazon, Tableau Software, Coursera, Duolingo, Kaplan, Indiana University, Penn State University, the College Board, the University of Sydney and Western Governors University.

The concept ""biometrics"" comes from the words, bios (life) and metron (measure), which means that all biometrical devices can measure and identify personal features. Each person has morphological features that are unique and therefore, different from everyone else. Face recognition allows us to determine the identity of a person by analysing the face. Unlike other types of biometry like iris or fingerprint, face recognition is non-intrusive; it does not require cooperation from the user. It just needs to capture the face of the person with a web cam. Enrollment The registration process begins by filling a registration form. This form allows the administrator to enroll users by entering their personal information and then, by starting the extraction process of their facial features which will configure the users  face pattern. The enrollment can be done with a username, ID number, pin number or card. In every case, the registry is done the same way. The only difference is when a user registers with a card, because it is necessary to first insert the card where the ID of that user is saved. Verification The verification / authentication process consists in comparing (1:1) the biometric features of two entities. The system verifies whether a user actually is who he/she claims to be. In order to do so, the system needs to know the identity of the user prior to the authentication process. There are two ways of introducing the user ID: through a card or typing manually the ID numbers, pin or name. Identification The identification process consists of carrying out a comparison (1:N) of biometric features. The system determines the identity of the user. For it, the extracted face pattern is compared against the systems  database of registered users. If the comparison result is correct, the system will highlight the user whose pattern, stored in the database, matches the most to the pattern obtained in the extraction process. +10 MUSERS +850 MAUTHENTICATIONS +40 CLIENTS.

CERTIFIED LIVENESS DETECTION IN 2 SECONDS. WORKS IN REAL-WORLD LIGHTING CONDITIONS. GREAT WITH GLASSES, MAKEUP & BEARDS. Certified Liveness + 3D Face Matching. SECURITY CERTIFIED  1 IN THE WORLD. Can a Selfie Really Provide Security? Obviously selfies are easy to take; the real question is if they can provide effective access security. Typically they can t, but ZoOm s patented process isn t just a selfie; it s a face scan that provides a 3D FaceMap and a Certified Liveness Check to ensure the user is physically present, and prevent masks, dolls, photos, or video deepfakes from fooling the system. The Liveness Detection algorithms must observe so many concurrent human traits that spoof artifacts can t recreate them all at once.  ZoOm s 3D Face Matching then compares the user to their previously-enrolled 3D FaceMap, and if the two FaceMaps highly match (1/4.2M+ FAR), the verified user is granted access. No Liveness Data = No Honeypot Risk Two types of data are required for every face authentication: Face Data (for matching) and Liveness Data (to prove the Face Data was collected from a live person).  Liveness Data must be timestamped, be valid only for a few minutes, and then deleted.  New Liveness Data must be collected for every authentication attempt. Face photos are just ""Face Data"" without any corresponding Liveness Data, so they cannot be used to spoof Certified Liveness Detection, and thus, storing photos does not create honeypot risk.  Think of the stored Face Data as the lock, the User s newly collected Face Data as a One-Time-Use key, and the Liveness Data as proof that key has never been used in the lock before. ZoOm s Encrypted 3D FaceMaps: Can t Be Phished From Users Aren t a Biometric Honeypot Stop Credential Sharing Stop Botnet Attacks Match 1:1 & 1:N at a 1/4.2M FAR Match Highly to a Photo ID Provide Anonymous Age Estimates. HOW ZoOm WORKS: During the ZoOm motion, the camera s view of the 3D face changes, observing perspective distortion and proving it is 3D. In under 2 seconds, ZoOm processes 30+ video frames and reverse engineers a 3D FaceMap from the standard 2D camera. CERTIFIED LIVENESS DETECTION: Over the last five years, we dove more deeply into anti-spoofing than anyone ‚Äì ever.  We have performed hundreds-of-millions of spoof attempts with every conceivable type of media and learned how to stop them. Attack Vectors include: 2D paper photos & digital images High resolution videos Image swap-in after liveness check Paper masks with eye & mouth cutouts Hollywood masks, wax figures & lifelike dolls Photos or video frames animated into avatars Video projections on 3D heads Sleeping users with closed eyes Impostors, lookalikes & doppelgangers. Passing the rigorous iBeta Level 1 & 2 tests prove ZoOm is an unsharable, unphishable biometric that is virtually impossible for criminals to spoof using today s media technology. BIOMETRIC BEST PRACTICES: Demand Certified 3D Liveness Detection.  Without it, you cannot trust unsupervised authentications and will be put at risk by ""Suprema"" type biometric data breaches.  With Certified Liveness, data breaches can t be leveraged against your users. Delete Liveness Data after each login and collect new Liveness Data for every new session.  This prevents biometric honeypots and allows for safe, centralized biometric storage. Centralized Biometric storage with Server-Side 3D Face Matching is the only way to truly replace passwords, enable cross-platform logins, simplify device upgrades, and allow multiple devices/users. Choose a diverse algorithm.  Don t be accused of having a ""biased"" biometric just because the training sets used to create it were too homogeneous.  ZoOm trained with users from over 170 countries. Certified Liveness + 3D Face Matching. 2D Face Recognition will never provide the accuracy needed for Face Authentication.  There is too much variability and overlapping similarity in human faces to achieve a high enough FAR (False Accept Rate) when they are flattened from 3D to 2D.

CORPORATE BACKGROUND. Filmetrics Corporation was incorporated in 2009, and has since forged a name of its own as a Philippine-based technology-driven enterprise providing premier identity management solutions, best practice insights and business intelligence to different organizations nationwide. Filmetrics serves as the Information Technology branch in the Freyfil Group of Companies. Its sister companies specialize on Construction, Geodetic Investigation, Mining and Aggregates, Engineering Consulting, Surveying and Mapping, Maritime Transportation and Real Estate. In September 2009, it entered into a joint venture with the Philippine Postal Corporation (PHLPost) to create a biometric data service facility that eventually paved the way for the partnership to provide a biometric identification and registration system to the Philippine s largest pension and retirement fund, the Social Security System. In 2010, this collaborative effort with SSS yielded a home-grown and cost effective, fully outsourced biometric enrollment service module that enabled SSS to become the first fully compliant government financial institution under the Unified Membership Identification (UMID) standards set by the Philippine government. Another milestone for the company is the five-year extension of the service contract to 2020, a testament to how Filmetrics is able to consistently deliver exceptional service and satisfy its clients  demands and expectations. In its vision to establish safe and secure digital bridges for everyone, Filmetrics, together with PHLPost, also launched in November 2014 a more secure and verifiable Postal ID card that gave millions of Filipinos better access to a government-issued ID that does not require any special skills, employment or professional license. By providing end-to-end service to PHLPost‚Äîi.e. supplying manpower nationwide highly trained to digitally capture biometric data of applicants; seamlessly transferring harvested data to a centralized facility for safekeeping; analyzing and cross-matching fingerprint data against the database of fingerprints called the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS); and producing the card infused with multi-layer security features, including but not limited to QR code, hologram and UV ink‚ÄîFilmetrics gives all cardholders and end users with an ID that fully guarantees a person s identity and combats any fraudulent transactions. Furthermore, Filmetrics has also established a partnership with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) with regard to mobile payout enrollment and tracking solution for limited mobility clients, with the Association of Carriers and Equipment Lessors, Inc. (ACEL) in developing secure identification and verification systems for training centers, and with the Halili-Cruz School of Ballet in line with mobile access control and identification systems. Today, Filmetrics prides itself in its capacity to adapt to growing innovation demand, and successfully serve its clients across a wide selection of industries.

The information that can solve and prevent these crimes exists, but it is too frequently locked away in legacy IT systems in the 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States. After September 11th, America spent billions of dollars on databases and information sharing systems that, unfortunately, were built on outdated technology. At the same time, companies with names like Google, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, Wikipedia, and YouTube were becoming household names for their ability to quickly sift through enormous amounts of data and deliver the right information to users almost instantly. As a company, we worked to replicate this capability for public safety. We are fueled by the simple and powerful idea that good outcomes for any organization are the result of the good decisions made by its members. Good decisions are made on good information, and in the 21st Century, good information invariably comes from a search engine. Forensic Logic has spent a decade collaborating with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to deploy its LEAP Network, a search engine created specifically for law enforcement.

In order to strive for global effectiveness, we have reviewed material issues across the Group based on materiality analysis, and have established a framework called ""Global Responsible Business"" by classifying issues into the following eight areas. Socio-Economic ICT Impact, Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, Wellbeing, Environment, Compliance, Supply Chain, Health and Safety, Community. Corporate Governance, Risk Management, Information Security, Quality and Customer Satisfaction. FUJITSU BIOMETRICS: Open Biometric technologies confirm an individual s personal identity. One-of-a-kind information, such as iris and palm-vein patterns and fingerprints, are extremely hard to duplicate ‚Äì and more secure. One-of-a-kind information, such as iris and palm-vein patterns and fingerprints, are extremely hard to duplicate ‚Äì and more secure. Define the right biometrics for your business As an enterprise organization, you still need to carefully consider your particular information security needs, and protect them from unwanted parties with relevant biometric identity management that brings together extreme ease of use and security across your enterprise. Fujitsu helps in selecting the best-suited biometric technology for your particular budget, environment, requirements and other criteria, for optimal results. As a leading provider and supplier of biometric authentication technology, Fujitsu has the expertise and insight to ensure your biometric authentication matches your business requirements. Effective biometrics should be: Permanent - and unchanged during an individual s lifetime Universal - based on a pre-defined, available technology Easy to collect - and use Safe - using validated methods specified by ISO standards Unaffected by outside environmental influences - such as light quality or weather Affordable. Fujitsu PalmSecure Palm Vein Authentication Technology. Biometrics as a Service. High Safety - palm vein is an internal biometric, therefore difficult to defeat compared to other external body biometrics such as fingerprint, face and iris. High Accuracy - it has a false acceptance rate under 0.00001% when the false rejection rate is 0.01% (with 1 retry) which makes it one of the most accurate biometric authentication system currently available in the market. High Acceptance - Contactless easy and hygiene operation with virtually 0% fail to enroll rate. Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì The Next Wave in Digitalization Today, a powerful new digital technology is emerging - Artificial Intelligence (AI). Previous waves of digitalization have delivered ubiquitous broadband, internet access for billions of people worldwide, mobile connectivity, and the Internet of Things (IoT) which has opened the door to a wealth of data and information. Now, by creating a real-time dialogue between people, things and information, we are entering a hyperconnected era where AI can be applied in real, everyday business situations. The world will never be the same again. In many cases, from handwriting recognition to passing mathematics exams, AI has already proven more accurate than human experts. However, that s not to say humans will be replaced by machines. With machines able to tackle more and more mundane tasks, workers will be enabled to focus on areas that add more value. Artificial Intelligence and Fujitsu At Fujitsu, people remain central to our vision, with AI solutions centered firmly on empowering workers and citizens, creating value and supporting the work they do. The impact of AI on our lives may not be something that we will notice or appreciate overnight, however, one thing is clear - its progress is constant and inevitable. It s only when we step back that we see how far we ve already come, and appreciate the journey that s still ahead. Fujitsu Zinrai brings together diverse AI techniques and development threads. Zinrai itself is neither a service nor a product, but a collective framework for the broad family of AI capabilities that are available to Fujitsu customers. Zinrai AI provides a human-centric approach to the co-creation of services and solutions. It utilizes  best of breed  global technologies that have been developed and deployed to meet ever-growing customer challenges.

With our Zinrai AI offering we add a wide range of value-added services to the Fujitsu portfolio - which is focused on enabling customers to digitalize with confidence. Transforming your industry with AI In the business world, AI is radically transforming many industries. With its ability to identify patterns and detect anomalies in mountains of digital information it s adding a new dimension, and once trained, it s tireless in processing many standard tasks. For example ‚Äì by adding AI to service desks and call centers, staff are freed from performing low-level, monotonous tasks, and are enabled to focus on addressing more complex technical problems/complicated requests, or delivering an enhanced customer experience/improved customer care. Here are just examples... Utilities Network Optimization Cyber attacks detection Transport Self-driving Traffic intelligence Logistics Vehicle routing Car dispatching Finance Consumer engagement Regulation and Security Manufacturing Equipment failure prediction Quality Control Healthcare Diagnosis support Drug discovery assist Retail Customer Flow Analysis Demand Forecasting Public Sector City Monitoring Citizen Services. AI in Financial Services One of the true strengths of AI is in the field of pattern recognition and analysis. Today, financial institutions are using artificial intelligence to model the potential direction of stock markets. AI is also extending the capabilities of analytics platforms - for instance, at Fujitsu, we have undertaken a proof of concept to analyze signatures to help detect fraudulent patterns. In addition, we ve also been talking to banks about the use of facial recognition in ATMs - not only to improve security but also to personalize services. Fujitsu Develops AI based Facial Expression Recognition Technology to Accurately Detect Subtle Changes in Expression. Fujitsu Develops Non-contact Biometric Integration Technology as an Optimal Solution for a Cashless Society. Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. today announces development of a non-contact, integrated biometric authentication technology that can identify a person using only their palm vein and facial data. Developed jointly with Fujitsu R&D Center Co., Ltd., the technology represents a step closer to the creation of a cashless society. Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd. and Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Inc. today announced the development of an AI facial expression recognition technology that detects subtle changes in facial expression with a high degree of accuracy. The new technology was developed in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. Fujitsu AI to Smooth Robot and Human Communication. Fujitsu today announced the development of the ""robot AI platform"" as a service platform providing natural communication between people and robots. As a first step for this platform, Fujitsu is offering a one-year trial service of the platform in Japan with a link to ""unibo,"" a Unirobot Corporation(1) communication robot, as well as consulting leading to official implementation. Going forward, Fujitsu plans to successively roll out services, such as the Robot AI Platform Basic Service for Multiple Devices, which can connect to various front-end devices, including tablets, smartphones, and intercoms. This platform offers communication technologies such as natural language conversation, facial expression recognition, voice-emotion analysis, and face recognition, as cloud services that can connect with devices such as robots. Robots connected to this platform can provide communication services via natural conversation suited to the situation and interests of individuals in a variety of settings, including customer service and elder care. By connecting this platform to existing customer systems, customers can add additional value from the use of robots to their work processes and services. Fujitsu Begins Sales of City Monitoring and Parking Management Solutions that Employ AI Technology. Fujitsu today announced development of solutions that make use of images from surveillance cameras deployed throughout a city or inside a facility, using high-speed image processing technology cultivated with its Human Centric AI Zinrai artificial intelligence and supercomputer technologies. FUJITSU Technical Computing Solution GREENAGES Citywide Surveillance software, which enables a real-time understanding of urban conditions, and FUJITSU Technical Computing Solution GREENAGES Parking Analysis software for intelligent parking management, will be available for sale in Japan from today. Using image analysis that employs advanced AI technology, Citywide Surveillance automatically extracts a variety of data from surveillance camera images, such as the type or make of vehicles, or the type of clothing someone is wearing, giving users a real-time understanding of movements throughout an urban environment. For customers with monitoring needs beyond vehicles or people, Fujitsu s AI experts will provide AI learning services with expanded image analysis capabilities, built on highly accurate recognition models. Parking Analysis supports improved management efficiency of parking lots or garages by ascertaining which parking spots are open or monitoring no-parking zones in real time.

Introduction We have been developing the technology for more than 10 years as a specialized face recognition company. We continue to research on face recognition research for a long time, and the technology performance of the algorithm is at the top level in the world. And we have a wide range of products such as access control, CCTV security surveillance, legal, finance, entertainment, automobile industry, We are supplying application products to the field. We began research on 2D facial recognition in mid-2006, succeeded in developing a commercial face recognition engine in 2011, and launched face recognition products. In 2016, the development of algorithms with dramatically improved recognition performance was completed, The recognition rate has reached the highest level in the world. HBFacePro Face Recognition Technology was recognized as the best technology in Korean Face Recognition Performance Evaluation by Korea Internet Promotion Agency (KISA) and the second highest recognition accuracy in FIVE (Face In Video Evaluation), a global evaluation test of NIST Achieved the   1 speed performance. In addition, the company s research team has also conducted research on gender and age recognition of facial images and released related products. Since 2015, 3D face recognition has been studied and biomechanical analysis of facial features has been under way. Now, based on the R&D achievements for deep learning, we are improving the recognition rate and improving the processing speed remarkably. For the first time in Korea, we have been continuously participated and certified in the global evaluation test conducted by NIST. In addition, for the first time in Korea, we have filed a number of PCT patents related to personal authentication technology, which combines facial recognition technology, to prepare for entry into the global market. Based on this, we have developed a face recognition solution that can interoperate with the member company of FIDO (Fast Identification Online Alliance), the international standard consortium of the certified authentication solution and the security SD card for the first time in the world. The company is also actively seeking to enter the global market through partnerships with partners around the world, such as a suspect search system, as well as affiliates with Aventura Technology, a US developer of integrated control system. Features Of HBFacePro Fast & Accurate face detection technology High-speed / high-precision detection is possible even on the face not facing the front. It has the fastest face detection technology among existing commercialized face recognition products with face detection speed of 18 ~ 20 faces / s when image resolution is 640 x 480. Using the learning algorithm that optimally tunes the frontal face pattern and the non-frontal face pattern, it is possible to detect up to 45 degrees in the yaw direction and 20 degrees in the forward and backward directions of the face. It is possible to accurately detect facial feature points including eyes, nose, and mouth even in images with low resolution and noise. Face recognition technology robust to various environmental conditions Generally, in the case of the third-party algorithm, recognition accuracy is relatively high for a regular face image such as FERET, but the accuracy is low for an irregular face image captured in a situation close to a real environment. HBFacePro face recognition technology is superior to images taken in each application environment. The recognition result mentioned below shows that the authentication is successful when the similarity degree 0.5 corresponding to the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.5 is set as the threshold and the two faces are compared. - Recognition is possible even if part of the face is covered because recognition is performed by paying attention to important face parts. - It has a strong resistance to environmental factors, including rotation, changes in illumination of the face. - Recognition is possible even when wearing glasses and accessories. - Sketch images such as low-resolution images and illustrations can also be recognized, which can be useful for searching for passports and driver s licenses, searching for suspects in legal investigations, etc. Advantages Over Others Comparison with Luxand Face Recognition Technology Luxand is an American face recognition company founded in 2005. Luxand have developed a technology that can perform fully automatic face recognition, starting with research on artificial intelligence and biometrics technology. Recently, we have been providing face recognition solutions while focusing on online entertainment business. Verification performance of HBFacePro algorithm and Luxand algorithm based on multi - ethnic Mugshot photo database is as follows. Comparison with NEC Face Recognition Technology The face recognition technology developed by NEC Corporation s central technology research institute was evaluated by NIST FRVT 2013 under the supervision of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the same way as in Luxand, NEC s face recognition algorithm and HBFacePro s verification performance were compared with NEC, which proved to be the world s highest level of face recognition technology. Algorithm Overview The HBFacePro face recognition algorithm consists of Face Detection, Landmarks Detection, Normalization and Preprocessing, Face Template Generation, and Comparison. Face Detection Face detection is the process of detecting the position and size of a face in a given input image. HBFacePro uses ADaboost with Composite Patterns (ACP) based on Adaboost machine learning algorithm and developed by its independent technology. It has robust characteristics against face rotation and illumination condition. 1) Creating an image pyramid Converts an input image to a monochrome image, and generates an image pyramid composed of element images of various scales. 2) Face Search For each image on the image pyramid, the template pattern is moved relative to the entire area of the image, and the image area on the template is extracted and input to the face detector to determine whether the face is a face. The face detector is a parallel multi-stage detector (Parallel Cascaded Detector) which is learned by using a template pattern that combines a symmetric pattern structure and an asymmetric pattern structure. 3) After the face search for all the images of the image pyramid is completed, the final detection result is calculated by combining the plurality of face detection information detected for the image pyramid. Landmarks Detection Landmark refers to the main points of the face such as eyes, nose, and mouth. HBFacePro utilizes ASM + FG (Active Shape Model and Face Graph) technology developed by its own research and development team and has 23 detectable face feature points. Normalization And Preprocessing In the normalization step, the facial part is separately extracted from the input image based on the positions of the detected facial feature points, and then normalization is performed by a rotation transformation to directly set the inclined face and a scale transformation to convert the image into a constant size image Thereby generating a face image. In the KH-SF-5 algorithm employed in HBFacePro 5.x version, the face image is normalized using face warping based face reshaping algorithm. Face Template Generation & Comparison In order to generate a face template, the face is divided into a number of cell regions by dividing the face into grids having a predetermined interval, and a frequency region-based feature extraction transformation is applied within each cell region to reflect unique characteristics in the cell region a local feature vector is extracted. The local feature vectors extracted for each part of the face are fused into a global feature vector reflecting the unique characteristics of the whole face. In order to reduce memory usage and file storage space during registration, a face template is generated by compressing facial feature vectors using an encoding algorithm. During enrollment, the face template is stored as a binary file with the registration ID or name, and the similarity between the registered face template (Gallery Template) and the input template (Probe Template) And if the similarity is equal to or greater than predetermined threshold value, it is determined that the person is the person.

FIND THE BEST TALENT FASTER WITH AI-DRIVEN PREDICTIONS. CONSIDER MORE APPLICANTS DRIVE CONSISTENCY REDUCE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS BETTER DECISION MAKING. BIAS, AI ETHICS & THE HIREVUE APPROACH. HireVue recognizes the impact that our software can have on individuals and on society, and we act upon this responsibility with deep commitment. The following principles guide our thoughts and actions as we develop artificial intelligence (AI) technology and incorporate it into our products and technologies. All of us now live in a rapidly shifting technology landscape in which change is constant. Because of this, HireVue practices will continue to evolve as we work with our customers, job-seekers, technology partners, ethicists, legal advisors, and society at large to ensure we are always holding ourselves to the highest possible standards. HIREVUE AI ETHICAL PRINCIPLES 1. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BENEFITTING SOCIETY We recognize that our software impacts individuals, companies and potentially our society at large and we are committed to understanding that impact and being thoughtful in all of our actions to do the greatest good. Our goal is to build systems that augment and improve human decision-making. We are focused on helping our customers find the best people to work for their companies as well as helping them grow and develop those people after hire. 2. WE DESIGN TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND FAIRNESS Because HireVue uses AI technology in our products, we actively work to prevent the introduction or propagation of bias against any group or individual. We will continue to carefully review the datasets we use in our work and ensure that they are as accurate and diverse as possible. We also continue to advance our abilities to monitor, detect, and mitigate bias. We strive to build teams from diverse backgrounds with diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to best represent the people our systems serve. 3. WE DESIGN TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE BETTER DECISIONS Our goal is to develop solutions that combine the strengths of machines and people together to improve decision-making. Our systems are designed to consume complex data to augment and improve human decision-making. We carefully design our products to provide clear understanding about what is being predicted, the confidence in the prediction and appropriate explanation of the data. We also provide feedback mechanisms that allow human input to build trust and improve overall functioning of our systems. 4. WE DESIGN FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION We are committed to incorporating privacy of data at each step of our process of technology development and deployment. We will give opportunity for notice and consent, encourage architectures on a foundation of privacy safeguards, and provide appropriate transparency and control over the use of data consistent with best practices and legal standards. 5. WE VALIDATE AND TEST CONTINUOUSLY All of HireVue s algorithms are tested prior to use to validate that they both do what they are intended to do and that their results generate unbiased outputs. Ongoing monitoring is performed to the fullest extent possible to ensure that real-world behavior matches the expected behavior. In 1978, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Process were jointly adopted by the U.S. Civil Service Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to provide a uniform set of principles to help govern the appropriate use of employee selection procedures and employment-related decisions. Consistent with the guidelines, our mission is not just to avoid bias in the inferences and employment decisions made based on our technology, but to use the technology to actively promote diversity and aid in the achievement of equal opportunity for everyone regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or disability status. Hirevue s data scientists work alongside a team of industrial-organizational (IO) psychologists with decades of assessment and adverse-impact testing experience. Consistent with generally accepted legal, professional and validation standards established within the field of psychology, our data scientists and IO psychologists continuously evaluate the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations and employment decisions made based on assessment results, while ensuring protected groups are not adversely impacted. HireVue has accumulated a significant and growing body of validity evidence to provide a sound scientific basis for the use of our assessments to aide with job-related decisions that minimize the potential for adverse impact. Our data scientists and IO psychologists build HireVue Assessment algorithms in a way that removes data from consideration by the algorithm that contributes to adverse impact without significantly impacting the assessment s predictive accuracy. The result is a highly valid, bias-mitigated assessment that helps to enhance human decision making while actively promoting diversity and equal opportunity regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or disability status.",https://www.hirevue.com/,2390,2/20/01,10/7/25

432,Humaniq,United Kingdom,2016,Private,1,0,1,1,1,0,https://humaniq.com/,https://humaniq.com/,,"Empowering the unbanked. Humaniq Care is a charity and fundraising platform built around our application and infrastructure. The first mobile service with the capacity to change the world. Humaniq is a new generation financial services with its own cryptocurrency, which is aimed at eradicating poverty amongst millions of people living in the emerging economies. For the unbanked people: Humaniq opens up the benefits of financial inclusion and grants access to a series of financial services. For businesses: Humaniq enables start-ups and projects to offer their services to an audience of billions. According to the World Bank s Global Financial Inclusion Database, there are currently 1.7 billion people on Earth who do not have access to official financial services. Humaniq s ever‚Äëgrowing userbase is a blue ocean for thousands of new projects. 1 billion new users in the coming years. $4 trillion potentially in user accounts. 200+ start-ups are planning to move onto the Humaniq platform. What makes Humaniq a big thing. Connecting the unbanked: 10 years of research across Asia and Africa, carried out by the authors of Portfolios of the Poor, showed that poverty proliferates in regions whose inhabitants do not have access to financial services. Humaniq is becoming the simplest route to financial inclusion for billions of people. User base exponential growth: According to Metcalfe s law, the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. For Humaniq, this means that the more unbanked people who join the system, the greater the motivation will be for other people to join. Join the global Humaniq community. Simplicity and safety for the unbanked. Biometric authentification: Users are verified by their face and voice, eliminating the need for formal documentation. Independent HMQ currency: Every new user receives $20 worth of HMQ in their account, the value of which bears no relation to their local currency. The interface is simple to interact with: Even for those who have never used gadgets before. Extraordinary opportunitites for business. Based on Ethereum blockchain protocol: Guaranteed security against hacking, corruption and loss of information thanks to complete decentralisation. Independent fund and accelerator: External projects and promising ideas can receive expert support and investment for a launch into the Humaniq system. Open API: Any project can merge into the Humaniq system. The world is ready for change. ""Including the poorest in the financial system increases the value of their assets, transforming the underlying economics of financial services through digital currency - helping those who live in poverty directly."" - Bill Gates. Humaniq use cases. Zero fee money transfers: Blockchain technology allows users to carry out direct money transfers, cutting out the middleman. The money is transferred as our HMQ cryptocurrency and withdrawn via authorised exchange points. Users can choose the point with the best exchange rate, therefore avoiding any financial monopolies. Remote work: Companies can utilise Humaniq s ever-growing user base to carry out tasks involving the processing of information. Users can decode and translate texts, identify photographs, locate geotags and so on, in return for renumeration. Charity without corruption: Charity, carried out in the traditional way, often leads to a large proportion of donated money falling into the wrong hands. Blockchain technology, combined with the infrastructure of Humaniq, ensures that donations are completely transparent: stakeholders are able to see what every penny is spent on and can be sure that all of their money is going to help people. Guarantor lending: Grameen Bank in Bangladesh has created a system of loans based on honesty and trust, which guarantees over 90% repayment. The Humaniq system allows for the creation of a similar system but on a global scale: every person on Earth will be able to take out a commission-free loan using nothing but a smartphone and the Humaniq app. Direct lending to entrepreneurs: Following the principle of the non-profit organisation Kiva Microfunds, which enables loans for entrepreneurs on low incomes, Humaniq will become a platform for both donations and loans. You can lend money to a business you d like to support, either as a grant or with the expectation of a return ‚Äì the blockchain technology makes this process incredibly simple and effective for both parties. Humaniq global challenge. Life-changing technology: Humaniq grew out of the idea that advanced technologies should benefit everybody. Now, we want to inspire developers from all over the world to come and join our movement. Humanitarian impact: Humaniq is not just a commercial project. It is a worldwide mission, aiming to give people in developing nations more power to change their lives.",https://humaniq.com/,656,10/18/00,9/22/25

Since the launch of the Visual Recognition API this past May, we ve seen users help California save water, perform infrastructure inspections with drones, and even find Pokemon. Powering many of these use cases are custom classifiers, a feature within Visual Recognition that allows users to train Watson on almost any visual content. Custom classifiers can be highly powerful but require careful training and content considerations to be properly optimized. Through our user conversations, we ve assembled a best practices guide below to help you get the most out of your custom classifiers. Examples of difficult use cases While Watson Visual Recognition is highly flexible, there have been a number of recurring use case that we ve seen the API either struggle on or require significant pre/post-work from the user. Face Recognition: Visual Recognition is capable of face detection (detecting the presence of faces) not face recognition (identifying individuals). Detecting details: Occasionally, users want to classify an image based on a small section of an image or details scattered within an image. Because Watson analyzes the entire image when training, it may struggle on classifications that depend on small details. Some users have adopted the strategy of breaking the image into pieces or zooming into relevant parts of an image. See this hail classification use case as an example (video). Emotion: Emotion classification (whether facial emotion or contextual emotion) is not a feature currently supported by Visual Recognition. Some users have attempted to do this through custom classifiers, but this is an edge case and we cannot estimate the accuracy of this type of training. Watson Visual Recognition: Quickly and accurately tag, classify and search visual content using machine learning. What is Watson Visual Recognition? Watson Visual Recognition makes it easy to extract thousands of labels from your organization s images and detect for specific content out-of-the-box. You can also build custom models to detect for specific content in images inside your applications. Overview Classify your images Understand an image s content out-of-the-box. Our pre-trained models enable you to analyze images for objects, colors, food, explicit content and other subjects for insights into your visual content. Train with less data Build a custom model with less training data and still achieve high accuracy. Object Detection Train a model to locate, count and understand relative size of multiple different objects. Why Watson for Visual Recognition? Easy Custom Training Quickly label images and train a model with Watson Studio s easy to use training experience. Visually Inspect Anything With a few images, train a computer vision model to detect damage on cars or parts of a circuit board using Watson Studio ‚Äî a free workspace where you can create, test, and manage your custom models. Bring AI into iOS apps with Core ML With Watson Visual Recognition for Core ML, you can build computer vision mobile apps with no downtime. Get started with Watson Studio to build, test, and deploy your own custom models to iOS. Autoglass¬Æ BodyRepair Belron brand Autoglass¬Æ BodyRepair applied Watson Visual Recognition to its website s booking page, which visually analyzes customer photos of vehicle damage and automatically recommends a repair price. The result is a 70% improvement in quote processing times by using AI analyses to determine repair costs. Coca Cola + IBM Field technicians used Watson Visual Recognition with Core ML to diagnose and correct problems on-site with little or no network connectivity. With the AI capabilities of Watson Visual Recognition and Core ML, relevant information is put directly into a tech s hands the moment they need it, to resolve issues quickly and efficiently. Pulsar With Watson Visual Recognition, Pulsar can look beyond image captions for a more in-depth understanding of the way audiences interpret and respond to imagery.

In a very short amount of time, advancements in digital technology have changed the way we live. In the not so distant past, forgetting your wallet meant a U-turn straight back home. Today, with a few swipes, taps or clicks on your smartphone, you can prove your identity, make a money transfer, sign a banking contract, order a ride, go shopping and dine out with friends. The trust of consumers is the basis for any form of transaction. But how can we ensure this effortless swiping doesn t fall into the wrong hands? 1,800 financial institutions (including most of the world s largest banks) trust us + 2M cards digitalized per month in the 3 major digital wallets  1 mastering the largest biometric acquisition and verification projects in the world. Studying the world around us While designing IDEMIA s solutions, we tapped into our own curiosity and looked all around us for sources of inspiration. We observed that today s financial institutions are undergoing a massive transformation from retail to digital banking and seeking out multichannel strategies to protect client relationships. To meet their needs, IDEMIA has given birth to offers that help financial institutions take on mobility and digitalization, shaping the future banking and payment customer journey. Our management of secret keys has become mission critical for the world s biggest companies.

Our identities are within each one of us. By leveraging biometrics for instance, we have advanced in a way that guarantees a highly secure payment experience in-store and online while still providing an enhanced and seamless cardholder experience. In short, we make it our mission to ensure that our customers have streamlined and highly adaptable solutions ‚Äì guarded by ironclad security measures ‚Äì at their fingertips whenever and wherever they need. After all, convenience and fluidity are nothing if not accompanied by peace of mind. Promises Everyday technology simplifies our lives just a bit more than the day before. With a tap on our smartphone or a fingerprint scan, we can prove our identities, open a bank account, define our PIN code, add our banking card to a new mobile wallet or make a payment. IDEMIA promises to ensure that all this effortless swiping never falls into the wrong hands. Biometrics for identification and authentication: We promise that ironclad security will never come at the expense of user convenience. The scene is all too familiar: you want to check your account balance on your banking app, or purchase something at your favorite boutique, only you forgot your PIN code or you re struggling with your login. At IDEMIA, we have innovated and tirelessly developed solutions that enable financial institutions to rely on trusted identities, verified by 100% reliable biometrics ‚Äì whether a quick smartphone selfie or a fingerprint scan on your bank card. Rest easy, your identity is in good hands. Adaptive Authentication: Authentication occurs each time users wish to access a service, perform a transaction, sign a contract or make a payment. It is the process of determining if they are whom they claim to be. When defining an authentication strategy, financial institutions need an approach that lets them easily address a complex and dynamic reality. They need to authenticate multiple customers  profiles for a wide range of use cases with different levels of risk. With IDEMIA s DACS‚Ñ¢* software platform they can adopt a global, adaptable approach to strong authentication. Following a Transaction Risk Analysis, end-users are prompted to authenticate with the best-suited authentication method, chosen among a wide range of factors (mobile, biometrics, SMS OTP, certificates, passwords‚Ä¶), according to their authentication policy. IDEMIA also offers an innovative authentication method, CloudCard+‚Ñ¢, relying on up to three authentication factors: the smartphone (possession), biometrics (inherence), and PIN (knowledge). Our solutions are compliant with the European Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) requirements for Strong Customer Authentication. Biometric Enrollment: Biometric innovations have been cropping up all around us and simplifying our lives. Instead of tapping in (and remembering!) a PIN code, we now unlock our mobile phones with a quick and simple scan of our fingerprint, face or iris. The arrival of biometric cards is finally hitting the banking industry. This major innovation is profoundly changing the card user experience. As they do with their smartphone, users can now replace card PIN codes with their fingerprint. In order to maintain the same stringent level of security with these innovative cards, securing the biometric data enrollment process is vital. IDEMIA s Biometric Enrollment Services offer two ironclad ways to capture and register user data: in-branch or from the comfort of home. Using a specialized tablet, developed by IDEMIA, banks can capture customers  biometric data and store information directly in the payment card itself. Cardholders may also use their smartphones to capture their biometric data and follow step-by-step instructions to securely store this data in their card from home. MorphoTablet 2i: Harnessing the power of 3 biometrics for mobile enrollment, authentication and identification. Biometrics are by far the most convenient and reliable means to identify and authenticate people. For law enforcement, border control, civil enrolment and elections, or firms that want to check employee/visitor IDs, the use of MorphoTablet‚Ñ¢ for fingerprint and facial recognition has already proved invaluable. Today, IDEMIA has taken that solution to a new level. MorphoTablet‚Ñ¢ 2i by IDEMIA enables improved universality and security by including all three biometrics in one mobile terminal: fingerprint, facial, and now iris. In civil society, for example, MorphoTablet‚Ñ¢ 2i can help authorities to securely enrol population onto a government program, ensure that they only vote once in an election or authenticate citizens for the renewal of their ID documents. To comply with KYC requirements in sectors such as financial services or mobile telecommunications, it can deliver rapid, digital onboarding of new customers. Meanwhile, thanks to the speed of iris recognition with MorphoTablet‚Ñ¢ 2i companies can achieve the highest levels of building security in a seamless way, or use the terminal to record time and attendance of employees. Payment for today and tomorrow. Banking anywhere, anytime: We promise services that keep up with today s hyper connected, need-it-now lifestyles. Open a bank account from home only with help of your smartphone is a new reality and it takes much less time. There s no need to visit your bank branch anymore to benefit securely from bank services. If you ve ever lost your wallet, you know the nightmare of a lost bank card ‚Äì you need to cancel the card, order a new one and then wait days, if not weeks, for a replacement. IDEMIA s innovations in card issuance allow banks to provide replacement cards on the spot, guaranteeing that customers continue to spend using a secure payment method. On top of it, they can also select a personalized card design and PIN code. Subscribing to a new contract ‚Äì credit loan, new payment card ‚Äì can be done remotely as well, with the same legal value as an in-person signature. ID Proofing: Acquiring and verifying the user s identity in-branch or online to access bank services. Financial institutions need a high level of trust before they can do business online. Their challenge as they go digital is knowing who are the people they transact with, to comply with regulations (Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering‚Ä¶) and fight against fraud. That makes trusted online identity verification a must-have. IDEMIA s ID Proofing solution allows customers to completely digitalize the user registration process whatever the channel, ensuring digital identities that can be trusted. This way, financial institutions can build a robust ID repository while balancing the demand for security, convenience and compliance. IDEMIA s solution enables ID proofing, anytime, anywhere, and on any device, combining: - Capture of biometrics and personal user data through multiple channels (via the user s mobile, remotely assisted by agent, in-branch) - Built-in global ID verification capabilities (ID document, biometrics, KBV*, counter-fraud checks‚Ä¶) - Identity verification process adaptable to specific local regulations - Fast and friendly user experience - Privacy by design. Issuance Services. Mobile Operators: Securing Mobility and Beyond The number of smartphone users will exceed 6 billion by 2020 ‚Äì and for good reason. These mobile devices put an incredible amount of information in the palm of our hands: our schedules, banking details, emails, and anything else we might need. While technology responds to new connectivity challenges and opportunities ‚Äì particularly with the growing IoT market ‚Äì heightened protection of our digital identities is needed more than ever. 500 mobile operators around the world (including leading mobile operators worldwide) trust us 100+ Subscription Manager solutions won in consumer and M2M 100+ OTA platforms deployed around the world.

The following discussion examines the significance of individual identification documents as well as propose security advancements that work to keep your identity safe in a rapidly changing world. Facial recognition: A strategic imperative for national security. AUTOMATION, INNOVATION, AND PRIVACY: VIDEO INVESTIGATION AND ITS ROLE IN PUBLIC SAFETY Over the past several years, the massive growth and innovation seen in the public safety and security industries has perhaps been overshadowed by a substantial pushback from privacy advocates who see these developments as moving us closer to a police state. Other markets, such as home automation, are forced to address similar concerns without the obligation to put the public interest first. This evolution coincides with an explosion in the availability of raw data, fueled by the rapid drop in cost of underlying security technologies such as cameras. FACE RECOGNITION ‚Äì A CRITICAL TOOL IF DEPLOYED RESPONSIBLY Recently, San Francisco became the first major American city to ban local government agencies  use of Face Recognition technology (FRT). Overall anti-police sentiment has contributed to a dozen U.S. cities passing similar laws, with 20 or so others weighing similar legislation. While most consumers have willingly sacrificed digital privacy in exchange for convenience, many are staunchly opposed to any attempts by law enforcement agencies to use biometrics. While it would be dismissive to say that these concerns are unfounded, bad actors may use public pushback on FRT to their advantage. FORENSIC FACE COMPARISON TRAINING.

Our patent-pending technology creates new possibilities while upholding privacy and our human rights. Indivd uses image data to create valuable insights like re-visits without processing biometric data or storing personal data. Privacypodden audits Indivd s unique technology. Indvid applies for new patents and expand the patent portfolio. Transforming store data into a proactive retail experience. The pressure is very high on the retail industry when the society transforms from analogue to digital. In this major upheaval, increased customer insights are vital for the industry if it s going to be able to strengthen its relevance, be more effective and survive. A status quo which might be changed with the help of Indivd. We offer retailers a unique insight into all their store visitors interest, behaviors. Our unique technology is able to re-identify all visitors over time and place. From one day to another and from one location to another location in another city or country. Data we can use to create insights like revisit frequency, bounce rate, conversion queue statistics, visitor profiles and about 100 more. Privacy-driven technology development. Face it! Indivd is founded on an idea of privacy-driven technology where human rights are at the core of the development. Because the commercial and political interests to use non-democratic technologies to control and monitor our lives is a threat to democratic societies. Legislation like GDPR is an important tool to manage our rights but that s not enough. The development and integration of non-democratic technologies are already taking place. Facial recognition is a no-go-zone and we say no to facial recognition based on UN s 12th article, The right to privacy. You don t need to surveil ‚Äì and in the long-run control ‚Äì to better understand us humans. We strive to prove that there are better technologies for this that help us to promote ‚Äì and not counter ‚Äì privacy. We achieve this by: Privacy innovations Creating privacy-innovations that raise the overall privacy in society, Work for better awareness Participating in debates and work for better awareness of the big privacy issues, Supporting Supporting and funding good privacy-initiatives. Indivd is founded by an international mix of serial entrepreneurs, developers, and leading AI Scientists. Some of us has built one of the fastest growing SaaS companies in Sweden while others are experts in neural networks, reinforcement learning and has worked on an effort to create a full-scale simulation of the learning human brain. How can you claim that Indivd is legal? We cannot claim to be legal since this is a question for legal experts and the authorities. We have followed the procedures of GDPR which says that we are supposed to do a balance test (DPIA) with legal experts. A test where the legal expert claimed that Indivd is legal. How can you be so sure of that the technology is GDPR compliant? Indivd is built as an alternative technology, which does not process biometric data or store personal data. Our anonymized facial recognition has a clear equivalence with best practices within the research dataset and the guidelines developed by Eurostat. We use much higher anonymity criteria than publicly released anonymized medical data and similar sensitive data and our technology is audited by several legal experts which claims that Indivd is legal. The legality is partly because we do not process biometric data, do not save personal data, solve major challenges for physical retail stores and are less intrusive than the techniques / methods currently used in the stores. Indivd at Nordic Privacy Arena ""We have eliminated the huge risks of facial recognition."" Transparency and privacy important core values for Indivd. As part of this ambitious and serious preparatory work, we have also decided, before submitting the application to The Swedish Data Protection Authority, to allow Privacypooden¬¥s data protection experts to carry out a tough corresponding audit. ""Facial recognition technology is mature, accurate, only takes half a day to set up, and it can already deliver good statistics today,"" says Fredrik Hammarg√•rden, Head of Commercialization at Indivd, in an interview in the podcast Effekten, where the problems with the new technology are discussed.",https://www.indivd.com/,105,1/15/18,8/30/25

Explore our Plug & Play Facial Recognition. AI - Powered OCR & Facial Authentication Digital Onboarding Toolkit. Innovatrics ABIS Biometrics, tailored. NIST FRVT: Innovatrics Face Recognition Technology Confirmed as Top Performer. About Innovatrics: We are an independent, trusted partner for biometric identity management technology. To date, we have successfully completed over 500 projects in 80 countries and over a billion people have been biometrically processed using Innovatrics software. TOP RANKED TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIVE APPROACH PROACTIVE CUSTOMER CARE SMART SOLUTION. Our technology advantages. Blazing Performance: Industry-leading matching speed. Speed is in our DNA. Our fingerprint matching algorithm is now the fastest in the world with a matching speed of 1.04 billion per second on a standard server. Continuous innovation has helped us achieve this blazing performance, ensuring that we have stayed ahead of our competitors and that our unique algorithm continues to underpin the fastest AFIS solution available on the market. We are not just leading innovators in the area of fingerprint biometrics; our facial recognition technology is also a top performer. Continuous development of our algorithm, combined with innovations such as newly introduced GPU acceleration support means our facial technology is now capable of performing thousands of facial template extractions per second. As well as underpinning our fingerprint and face technologies, our culture of innovation and passion for challenges drives our research and development in other biometric modalities. Where speed matters? Matching speed is a key factor for large-scale projects with multiple millions of enrollees. A high-performance algorithm means less servers are required to support the solution, while maintaining high throughput and very low latency. This results in greatly reduced response times, real-time identification and significant cost savings, especially when we consider very large systems with more than 100 million enrollees. Stunning Accuracy: Top accuracy in NIST PFT II, Top Ranked in FpVTE, Top Ranked in FRVT. Speed is important, but accuracy is critical. We don t compromise. Without accuracy, speed is irrelevant. From the very beginning, our algorithm has delivered stunning accuracy to our solutions. The founders of Innovatrics  first mission was to fix biometrics and to make biometric technology practical and reliable. By focusing on quality, investing in the smartest people and exploring new areas of deep learning, we ve managed to achieve industry-leading accuracy. Not only have we fixed the issues associated with biometrics ‚Äì we ve revolutionized the technology. Where accuracy matters? The industry-leading accuracy rate of our algorithm (99.98%), when deployed in a biometric identity management solution, results in dramatically lower error rates and greatly increased security and convenience. It also results in better performance in latent prints / poor quality image matching, enterprise 1:N identification (with only 1-2 fingers), hard to recognize prints / edge cases and enhanced performance on platforms with limited features (mobile & embedded). Innovatrics  industry-leading accuracy, identification speed and enrollment (extraction) speed, combined with agile design and low RAM consumption, mean our technologies are first in the world in operational ranking. Excellent Interoperability: Top results in interoperability and accuracy. Our technology consistently achieves top results in interoperability evaluations. Interoperability describes the extent to which systems and devices can exchange data, and interpret that shared data. For two systems to be interoperable, they must be able to exchange data and subsequently present that data such that it can be understood by a user. Why interoperability matters? Interoperability is critical in large biometric authentication projects. Many large biometric authentication systems in government agencies, financial institutions or large organisations are based on the rudimentary requirement of fingerprint template interoperability. Our vast experience has helped us to ensure that our fingerprint templates enable every certified matcher to gain maximum accuracy, and our template matcher delivers first class accuracy with every interoperable fingerprint template. Multiple Platform: Ready to run on a complete range of hardware and software platforms. We don t bind our customers to any kind of hardware or software. We have designed our biometric technologies to be ready to run on a broad range of hardware and software platforms, meaning customers don t need to worry about compatibility issues. The biometric solution you select today must be able to integrate with the technologies of tomorrow.  We are able to port our components and libraries also to unusual platforms and those with limited computing power and memory. Why it matters? Easy integration Quick deployment No vendor lock-in Hardware and software independence Be it fingerprint matching, face detection and tracking or face matching, there are no limitations for you in choosing your preferred hardware or software platform.

We are a diverse team of world-class university academics and cutting-edge mobile and web developers, led by senior executives experienced in building and running global-scale internet services. Award winning technology. Valued global contributors. The iProov story. Why was iProov founded? It came from a lesson learned the hard way. In 2008 Founder Andrew Bud was Executive Chairman of the previous business he founded, mBlox Inc. the largest provider of enterprise-to-consumer text messaging in the world. By 2007 it was also one of the largest processors of SMS mobile payments in the world, clearing and settling around $500m a year, with low fraud rates, growing revenues and happy mobile operators. The attack. Then in 2008, it all went horribly wrong. Fraudsters in the UK discovered how to fake consumer consents and many people lost money. Andrew was held to account by the press, and the company asked if it had been complicit or just negligent.  The answer, of course, was neither and the business was later commended by the regulator on its exemplary handling of the incident. The lesson. But it taught Andrew a lesson: the crucial importance of good, strong authentication. Simple enough to serve the needs of impatient mobile users, but secure enough to withstand the attention of even the most determined, sophisticated attackers.  Solving the SMS problem was straightforward. Solving the app and web problem was not. A new kind of solution was needed ‚Äì intuitive, simple to use, cross-platform, impervious to compromise of the device or its software and immune to phishing. How might this be achieved?  The answer became iProov. The future. iProov continues to be trusted throughout the online ecosystem by delivering authentication and verification simply and securely, based on a genuine one-time biometric.  Ensuring the genuineness of a biometric is and will continue to be one of the great continuing challenges for the online ecosystem.  iProov will continue to lead by meeting that challenge, through unceasing research and development, observing and adapting to the changing threats and through collaboration with a worldwide network of trusted partners. World leading technology. Presentation attack detection (PAD) and face matching are the two outstanding capabilities of iProov s core one-time biometric technology. We deliver these with exceptional usability through our patented user interface and Flashmarks. Our systems are resilient and adaptive. All our technology is our own IPR.

522,Is It You,Israel,2012,Private,0,0,1,0,0,0,https://www.isityou-online.com/,https://www.isityou-online.com/,,"PREVENT BIOMETRIC FRAUD. Introducing IDENTITY BEWARE from IsItYou. WHAT WE DO: Biometric Fraud Prevention Biometric modalities (face, eyes, voice) as identity means are rapidly emerging as the preferred choice to replace old passwords. Unlike passwords which can be changed, such identities are irreplaceable (something you are) and become high priority cyber attack targets. IsItYou uses AI-powered behavioral based technology as a security layer over such biometric modalities. It scans for potential fraud activity and keep consumers safe. IsItYou defines a new security standard to establish secure, trusted and personalized links between customers and the brands with which they carry out business. BEWARE: Safe Biometrics. Bottom Line: Is This User Human? There should be little doubt that passwords are on their way out with more advanced solutions taking over the market for authentication. Modern biometric modalities (face, eyes, voice) are rapidly emerging as preferred choices to replace old passwords. Unlike passwords that can be replaced, such identities are irreplaceable (something you are) and so become high priority cyber-attack targets. IsItYou developed deep AI-powered technology that can be layered over such authentication modalities to scan for potential fraud activity and keep consumers safe. IsItYou s Identity Biometric Early Warning Rating Engine (BEWARE) defines a new security standard to establish trusted and personalized links between customers and the brands with which they carry out business. Modern biometrics provide automated methods for individual authentication of a person by distinctive physical or behavioural characteristics, or both, that generate a unique biometric identity. The weakest aspect of any biometric modality is impersonation ‚Äìthe ability to circumvent the biometric authenticator and pretend that the subject under test is a real human being whereas in reality it is not‚Äì resulting in a fake biometric identity. The distinction whether a subject is a real human being or anything else is a multi-dimensional that cannot be addressed by simple, one-factor solutions. Based on a strong AI foundation, IsItYou has developed a technology that Fuses certain Physical body characteristics, Behavioural action patterns, Cognitive user reactions and Context-specific background geometries into a multi-class, deep self-learning engine capable of classifying biometric cyber-attacks. BEWARE s fusion process preserves the each biometric modality s markers for universality, uniqueness, and permanence while at the same time raising its resilience to impersonation attacks. Over 10 million of impersonation events across a wide range of situations were studied and classified over the course of five years. The findings from this effort were used to provide IsItYou s BEWARE with the very strong capability to differentiate between real and fake biometric identities. ONLY HUMANS ALLOWED Humans are complex creatures. They look a certain way, diffract light in a specific manner, their normal behavior includes recognizable traits. We combine user psychology, computer vision, sensor fusion, and ergonomics in a complex multi-layered analysis that provides you with a simple answer: Are they HUMAN? How to Prevent Bio-Identity Fraud? Frequently Asked Questions. I already have a face recognition solution, what can BEWARE add to it? Simply put: we can layer our impostor detector solution to whatever you ve already deployed. We can easily integrate with all major face recognition vendors to provide you and your users with an authentication solution you can truly trust. Really, it will work with other biometric engines? Yes. You can deploy IsItYou s BEWARE as an overlay to your current face recognition technology and for every recognized user it will give you an answer to the question: Are. They. Human? It sounds great, but what does the technology actually do? BEWARE integrates into your existing authentication solution and works with it to provide you with the ultimate in secure biometric authentication. BEWARE goes to work AFTER your biometric system has given the ""go ahead."" BEWAREgoes to work after your user has been successfully authenticated (it would be silly to scrutinize someone that was not even recognized by the system). Multiple layers and multiple factors are brought into the mix to determine whether the user that was just ""recognized"" is in fact the right human being. I ve heard about ""liveness detection."" Is this it? Yes it is, in more ways than one. In today s jargon, ""liveness"" detection is really motion detection. Put simply, it looks for things like blinking (movement of the eyelids), smiling, or a shake of the head. It assumes that all fraud attempts will be come in the form of a static photograph. IsItYou is different. We layer a number of methodologies that provide orthogonal responses to an authentication event. IsItYou uses an intelligent agent that adapts itself to the circumstance and helps the legitimate user reach a successful authentication. Our Technology. CONVENIENT: Convenience drives usage. To build a truly secure system it must be usable, and all things being equal, a more convenient security measure will be used more, and with higher policy-compliance than one that is cumbersome. ‚Äã BEWARE was built with this principle in mind. It examines a user s log-in attempt in the background, with none or almost no participation from the user. It requires no effort to comply, so people naturally use it more, and better. MULTI-LAYERED: BEWARE uses literally dozens of tests to determine whether a subject is truly a human or not. These tests, or ""filters,"" each work orthogonally to render a score. These scores are then analyzed to come up with a straight-forward answer. Having dozens of tests means that there is no single point of failure. No single filter that, if fooled, would render a false-positive determination. ENGINE AGNOSTIC: You may already have an authentication engine for mobile that uses face or eye biometrics. If so, we will be happy to add BEWARE S unique capabilities to your solution and upgrade its resilience in short order. If however, you do not already have a biometric solution, we will be happy to include IsItYou s own face recognition for you to use.",https://www.isityou-online.com/,11,8/31/13,3/30/22

We design street furniture that will develop or reinforce the identity of the site where it is located. From streetlights to mobile charging stations, we design street furniture and services that provide practical everyday benefits. From design to installation and upkeep, our street furniture and services are financed by advertising. From electric bikes to Wi-Fi hotspots, we continue to develop new services to meet your evolving needs. Our goal is to surprise and entertain you around the city with more interactive and creative advertising. OUT-OF-HOME ADVERTISING Activities In 1964, Jean-Claude Decaux invented advertising street furniture. Ever since, JCDecaux‚Äînow the global industry leader‚Äîhas been the only international player focused exclusively on outdoor advertising, developing 3 areas of business: street furniture, transport advertising and billboard advertising. OUR MISSION. Always keep innovating, for everyone s benefit. JCDecaux designs, installs and maintains a range of free or low-cost services for the benefit of cities, residents and travellers, including bus shelters, self-service bicycle schemes, passenger information panels and mobile charging terminals. These services are financed by advertisements that are located in busy thoroughfares, offering brands maximum visibility. Because it benefits all stakeholders‚Äîlocal governments, advertisers and users‚Äîthis business model is unique and sustainable, and has been a constant source of innovation for the past 50 years. It is adaptable to society s changing needs, as can be seen today in the integration of connectivity solutions. STREET FURNITURE. Inventor and global leader. Street furniture combines advertising with public services for city residents and travellers. Since the invention of advertising bus shelters in 1964, we have continuously improved and diversified our products. Our innovations are helping realise the vision of smart cities while providing the latest solutions to advertisers. Today, 3,890 cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants place their trust in JCDecaux. FOCUS. Cyclocity, leader in self-service bike rental scheme. Cyclocity¬Æ is a self-service bicycle scheme for cities. Its design is the outcome of years of work by our multi-disciplinary teams from the Industrial Division, the Graphic Arts Department, the IT Systems Division and the Innovation and Interactive Products Division. The Group continues to innovate to meet the needs of cities and their inhabitants, as can be seen in its 2015 launch of self-service hybrid bicycles with personal, portable battery. TRANSPORT ADVERTISING. Number 1 worldwide. JCDecaux manages advertising concessions in airports, metro systems, bus systems, trains and light rail. In line with our business model, we also take care of the design, installation, maintenance and financing of services like Wi-Fi connections and mobile charging terminals. We are constantly innovating to meet passengers  evolving needs. BILLBOARD ADVERTISING. Number one in Europe. Billboards are the oldest form of outdoor advertising. JCDecaux has revolutionised this medium by focusing on qualitative solutions. With innovations like scrolling panels, iconic giant displays and wall-wraps for fa√ßades, advertisers achieve maximum impact. These spaces are strategically located and fit harmoniously into their surroundings. FOR PARTNERS True to its sustainable business model, JCDecaux offers a vast array of services for inhabitants and passengers in urban environments. OUR DRIVE Innovation JCDecaux was created thanks to an innovation: the advertising bus shelter. And with it arrived a new business model: street furniture financed by advertising. We haven t stopped innovating ever since, continuously offering more services while enhancing the surrounding environment. CREATION. An ongoing approach. JCDecaux s success has always been grounded in a unique spirit of innovation and an ambitious Research & Development policy. The effectiveness of this strategy can be seen in all of our products and services. Cyclocity self-service bikes are now a must-have all around the world, and interactive screens and Wi-Fi terminals are appearing everywhere in cities and on transport systems.  Innovation enables us to anticipate constantly changing needs, to contribute to the design of the city of tomorrow and to help make transportation systems more enjoyable for passengers. IN-HOUSE EXPERTISE. Four pillars of innovation. JCDecaux s innovations meet four criteria: quality, style, functionality and environmental performance, which means adhering to eco-friendly design (strength, durability, low energy consumption and the use of recyclable materials). Only the longstanding multidisciplinary expertise offered by JCDecaux can meet such exacting requirements. Our 120 engineers and technicians working in R&D handle 400 projects a year. At any given time, our teams are working on 50 ongoing projects. ADAPTABILITY. Anticipating new forms of usage. JCDecaux is a company with a local presence, whose solutions interact daily with users in over 80 countries. This proximity inspires us and drives us to continuously adapt to changes in technology, user behaviour and client needs. Accordingly, JCDecaux s R&D efforts have evolved to incorporate new partners like start-ups and research centres directly into the innovation process. This new structure has also facilitated collaborative efforts to upgrade existing street furniture, which are essential to keeping up with the growing complexity of digital platforms. AWARDS. Recognition of our creative solutions. Our ongoing pursuit of excellence in design and sustainable development has been recognised on numerous occasions. Over the years, JCDecaux has won Good Design Awards (the world s oldest and most prestigious award of its type) and Green Good Design Awards for the quality, style and sustainability of its product designs. WHERE STYLE MEETS SERVICE Design JCDecaux offers accessible services to meet the daily needs of all. Quality and style are essential components of these services, resulting in street furniture that is as attractive as it is practical. HIGH STANDARDS, EVERY DAY Cleaning & Maintenance JCDecaux is recognised by cities, transport authorities and advertisers for the quality of its maintenance and upkeep services, which contribute to each location s appeal every day. CLOSER, MORE RESPONSIVE AND MORE FLEXIBLE Digital JCDecaux s attractive digital screens offer a new way to inform and advertise that is effective, customised and responsive. IN REAL TIME. The right message, at the right place, at the right time. Digital screens by JCDecaux are placed in busy thoroughfares, where they are visible daily to residents and travellers. For cities and transport authorities, they offer a responsive solution that can deliver a wide range of messages in real time, like weather, traffic, event announcements and alerts. Their flexibility also makes it possible to broadcast a customised message at a specific place and time. For example, an airport can greet travellers exiting a plane in the language of their country of origin. Digital screens offer adaptability and targeted information, whatever the need. DIGITAL COMMUNICATION. Impact and engagement. Thanks to their visibility and stylish design, JCDecaux s digital platforms can enhance the impact of communication campaigns by cities and transport authorities. A truly complementary solution, they can also be combined with other forms of media, with the option of using the same editorial line and graphic elements. Connected and context-responsive, they can even be linked in real time to social networks like Twitter and Facebook. They provide a flexible and effective addition to a comprehensive, multi-channel strategy. Distributing content on entertainment, culture, news and more, the digital platforms provide an enhanced experience for residents and travellers. INTERACTIVE DIGITAL PLATFORMS. Smart service. Interactive digital platforms are equipped with screens that inform residents and travellers about their city.

WE BELIEVE EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE. Kauel s culture: Our team s positive attitude allows us to deliver extraordinary results and unique solutions for our clients in the best time lapse possible. We are moved by knowing that with our work and knowledge, we contribute to peoples  well-being, through improving companies and organizations whose products and services are translated in better life quality for them. AVANT-GARDE IS WHERE WE ARE AT. ONLY THE BEST ARE PART OF OUR TEAM. WE TRULY LISTEN THE NEEDS. POSITIVES WHEN FACING CHALLENGES. EVERY PROBLEM HAS A SOLUTION. WE BREAK PARADIGMS AND CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO. This technology and innovation company began in 2004, when our founder Edmundo Casas, a recent graduate in Electronic Engineering from the ""Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a"" in Chile, started selling equipment to set up school s physics laboratories and because he prepared boxes of 10 watts of power that equaled one-hundredth of the 745.5 watts of a Horse Power, he decides to call his, at that time Start-up, Colt Power Ideas , being ""Potrillo"" the Spanish word for Colt. The company quickly begins to grow and Edmundo invites his friend Cristian Romero, also an Electronic Engineer from the same university, to join as co-founder and during the company s first 4 years they focused on the development of innovative technology products for entertainment, culture, and education purposes. The year of Chile s Bicentennial celebration (2010), brought the first investors interested in making the Colt grow, which resulted in Alejandra Mustakis betting on us and joining the team as a key player for the growth of the company as we know it. It was her father, Mr. Constantino Mustakis, who suggested that it was time to grow and from that day we stopped being a ""Colt"". This is how in 2010, we released a new name, and became Kauel , which means ""Faul"" in Mapudungun (Chileans second native language), while creating the hologram pyramid, an invention made with one of our own patents, which burst into the marketing industry and also received the Best Invention Award of the year , awarded by Chilean Ministry of Economy. In 2012, our invention our Kinect technology is awarded the President of the Republic Award as the most Innovative Development and this in conjunction with our developments placed us at the center of innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship of the country. The following year, we are once again recognized, this time by the Chamber of Commerce and ProChile, for exporting technology and having the Papalote and the Culiacan Museum in Mexico as our clients, exhibiting our technology. By 2015 we decided on a new strategic path towards other industries and found new opportunities in the service, power supply, oil, mining, retail, and health sectors to deliver high-value solutions. This aroused interest in the company once again, and that is how in 2018 we added new investment partners to our board of directors. This time is INVEXOR Capital , who sees in us a strong company with the possibility of placing Chile on the map of the technological vanguard, with Kauel being the epicenter of the Industry 4.0 in Chile and Latin America. Technologies We use to change the world... WE SPECIALIZE IN: Artificial Intelligence (AI) It is the artificial imitation of human intelligence processes done by machines. These processes include learning (the acquisition of data and rules for the use of information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or final conclusions) and self-correction. Virtual Reality (VR) It is an environment composed by different scenes and virtual objects of real appearance generated by computer technology, which gives the user the feeling of being immersed in it. Augmented Reality (AR) It refers to the real-time insertion, of virtual elements within the physical universe. A person can observe the real world with certain elements added, which appear in their lenses or screen as digital information, through the use of lenses or other special devices. Internet of Things (I.o.T) The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of connected computing devices. These are mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that have unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data through a network, without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions. Big Data (BD) Big Data is a term that describes the large volume of data, both structured and unstructured, which are generated from processes. But it is not the amount of data that is important, what matters with Big Data is what companies and organizations can do with it. & Nbsp; Big Data can be analyzed to get ideas and trends & nbsp; that lead to better decisions and strategic business movements. Analytics It is responsible for analyzing and shaping the information, in a friendly way, used for decisions decision making on different aspects such as processes, Web, e-Commerce, companies or brand in general.
