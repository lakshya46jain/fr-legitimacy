Data security at the highest level. >COMBINING CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT WITH REVOLUTIONARY NEW WAYS TO PREDICT LIFE EVENTS IN REAL TIME. As finalists in the Vizag Fintech Festival, we have just been awarded $110,000 to open an office there. We look forward to the incredible new opportunities that await us. WE HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED AS A LIFE EXPECTANCY PROVIDER BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA. DR. JAY OLSHANSKY, OUR CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF SCIENCE OFFICER, HAS PUBLISHED A NEW WHITE PAPER ON: Longevity and Health of U.S. Presidential Candidates for the 2020 Election. AI-POWERED LIFE EVENT PREDICTION IS HERE. At Lapetus Solutions, world-renowned scientists leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop revolutionary new ways to predict life events in real time, combining: Sensory Analytics An emerging science-based technology that uses digital images to examine an individual s physical features to determine longevity, health status and disease susceptibility. Life Sciences Combining decades of longevity research with biodemography at the core, specific covariates linked to longevity are identified and predictive algorithms are generated. Dynamic Questioning Scientifically formulated questions that change according to responses provide more insight and accuracy into individual longevity than standardized questionnaires. CHANGING THE FACE OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING. CHRONOS While traditional underwriting can take up to a month, CHRONOS delivers more accurate results in seconds Combining facial analytics, biodemographic information and dynamic questioning, CHRONOS returns precise and reliable scores. How Industry is Using Our Tools. Lapetus Solutions Inc. (LSI) integrates science and technology with machine learning to develop tools and platforms that enable industries relying on life event prediction to reduce and replace their dependence on traditional assessment methods with faster, more cost-effective and increasingly accurate results. By combining Life Sciences, Sensory Analytics and Dynamic Questioning to provide real time insight into an individual s health status and longevity, as well as to examine risk within specific groups, our tools also combine to form the basis of three breakthrough customer engagement platforms, delivering fully customizable, end-to-end solutions for the life insurance and financial planning industries. Our team is comprised of internationally recognized scientists in their fields, including Biodemography, Facial Analytics, Health, Aging and Data Science. Working together and drawing from the data and research of thousands of global experts, they leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to more accurately predict life events in real time, including mortality, morbidity and healthy lifespan. Lapetus was the Greek god of mortality. Our first platform, Chronos, is named after his brother, the Greek god of time. The panels represent the three phases of life according to evolution biology: childhood, adulthood and old-age, through which a mortality curve runs, reflecting the fundamental linkage between biology and duration of life that is at the foundation of Lapetus biodemographic thinking and methods. Life Sciences: Combining decades of longevity research with biodemography at the core, specific covariates linked to lifespan are identified and predictive algorithms are generated. Through the compilation, distillation and analysis of complex and constantly evolving data from thousands of global researchers, our scientists assess and identify market-specific trends, linking specific questions to mortality risk and survival prospects. All of the following are taken into account in calculating results: anthropology, ecology, embryology, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, genetics, molecular biology, pathology and population genetics. Our Life Sciences tools can be used to provide: Life Expectacy (LE) and Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) estimates Trend analysis on blocks of insured populations Mortality trends using Live Life Tables. Sensory Analytics An emerging science-based technology that uses digital images to examine an individual s physical features to determine longevity, health status and disease susceptibility. LSI scientists use machine learning techniques to build sensory analytics algorithms that provide real time results. They are currently researching the enhanced information that sight, voice and skin-based analytics can provide and will continue to develop new algorithms and corresponding tools based on their findings. From just a simple selfie, our Facial Analytics technology examines 100 s of points and 1000 s of regions on the face to instantly provide: BMI calculation Estimated Age Gender Smoking Indication. Dynamic Questioning Scientifically formulated questions that change according to responses provide more insight and accuracy into individual longevity than standardized questionnaires. For years, traditional methods of predicting life events have relied on asking the same types of questions. The Lapetus platform uses a range of highly predictive and variable questions based on aging science that change dynamically based on initial responses, providing results that are unique to each individual. Dynamic Questioning enables us to identify people who are likely to live exceptionally long lives, even in the face of potentially harmful behavioral risk factors. Not all smokers are equal By combining Life Sciences, Dynamic Questioning and Sensory Analytics, it is now possible to identify smokers who are likely to live longer, as well as detect when someone has not been truthful about their past and present smoking habits on an application form. Based on our two key areas of scientific study, Life Event Sciences and Sensory Analytics, we have developed a variety of customizable, risk assessment tools that can be used individually or in combination. They are grounded in algorithms using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, continually improving with more data. Everything you need to know about our proprietary data collection initiative. What it is A continuous international cross-sectional survey designed to enhance and further develop the field of Sensory Analytics, SMILe will immediately enhance smoking validation and be used in the future to identify chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease and dementia. Supports the global expansion of our predictive algorithms Helps our Facial Analytics engine account for differences in populations across the globe Represents a giant leap forward in our future ability to detect and predict fatal diseases and disabling health conditions. How SMILe works Individual surveys collect images, video, demographic and health data Collections use IRB approved protocol with standardized equipment Data collection teams will be engaged for global markets. Demographic Data Multiple points on each participant are captured. Image/Video Data Standardized equipment is utilized in all markets Still images and videos are captured on each participant. How we will use the data? Smoking detection Age detection Gender detection Age progression Disease detection. Who will benefit from the data?

Founded in 2016, LetinAR Inc, a startup company made its appearance in the scene of Augmented Reality presenting a new paradigm-changing technology ‚Äì PinMR‚Ñ¢ lens. This technology was developed mainly to redress common failings found in current products; heavy and expensive hardware, and deficient functions that inhibit the construction of real eyeglasses-shaped designs and render wearability and usability mediocre at best. Accurate Color Expression: An Edge over diffraction-based or reflection-based systems. Light and Thin: Super-Thin Pin Mirror Lens. Expanded DoF: Shows Augmented Reality (AR) Image wihtout inducing dizziness. PinMR‚Ñ¢, Next-generation AR optic technology. Numerous AR global leaders have been diversely attempting to endeavor to develop AR devices using the Half-Mirror Combiner, Diffractive/Holographic Waveguide or Geometrical Waveguide, yet they have not met end-users  needs and expectations. This is mainly owing to bulky form factors, narrow FoV, poor color expression, high prices, and costly and complex manufacturing mainly caused by the complex structure of the optical system. All these issues vitiate the widespread commercialization of AR devices.  PinMR‚Ñ¢ technology LetinAR invented was inspired by the pinhole effect, the process of placing a pinhole before the human retina resulting in clearer images of the object. By switching pinholes with tiny mirrors, the light from a micro-display can be reflected and guided into the pupils. The mirrors are invisible to the human eye ‚Äì seamlessly along with real-world images. PinMR‚Ñ¢ with its incomparable performance resolves the issues identified by consumers and AR companies so far, establishing itself as the frontrunner of the field.

Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or Google Pay. Absolute control With your phone, you can see and do everything. Only you can access this information, since each of the app s advanced features is protected by biometric security. Instant payment receipts Block your payment cards Limits Spending categories (coming soon). This is what the future looks likeYou didn t realise that this was even possible. So we created exclusive tools for you, before you could have even dreamt them up. A universal card linked to all your accounts Dynamic virtual cards A universal IBAN account (coming soon) Joint accounts. Who is Lydia? Lydia is a payment app that aims at simplifying the way we re managing our money. You can now pay anywhere, send money instantly, share expenses and manage your accounts using your mobile. To achieve this ambitious goal, Lydia brought together a team of experts specialised in payment methods and mobile payment security, and joined forces with the very best partners in French banking: Payline (Cr√©dit Mutuel group) to acquire and conserve data relating to bank cards as well as the Soci√©t√© Financi√®re du Porte Monnaie √âlectronique Interbancaire (SFPMEI) to manage and guarantee all transfers. Our mission: Make your payments easier. At the moment, how you pay is dictated by where you are and who you re paying. Cash at the cornershop, a cheque at the doctor s, card for online purchases, or a bank transfer to pay back a friend. This is hardly very practical, and is often extremely frustrating - especially when the nearest ATM is good ten minutes  walk away, and it s raining. In the age of smartphones, online payments, and the ""cloud"", it s strange that we re still using pieces of metal and paper to make payments. Why can t there be one, simple, universal means of payment to pay for anything, anywhere? That s what was keeping us up at night when we launched Lydia in 2013 with one goal: to be able to pay for anything easily, quickly, and securely with the one object you always have on you. Your phone. Lydia is the labour of love of a team of very passionate, extremely ambitious, and slightly crazy people. We have made it our personal mission to push the boundaries, break down the barriers between us and a cashless society, and to encourage the rise of mobile payments globally. We re a demanding bunch, obsessed with finding the optimal technological, design, and legal solutions to build the best payment app in the world. Technology is cool, but it shouldn t be an end in itself. For us, the real goal is to make life easier - by using the latest, cutting-edge technology. That s exactly what we re trying to do with mobile payments: we re not interested in building a trendy gadget that you get bored of after a week, and, above all, you shouldn t be held hostage to a particular app, platform, or bank. We believe that mobile payments must provide a real solution to a genuine problem. Everything we do is guided by common sense and our universal ambition: a service for everything and everyone. So, who s Lydia? Well, the name actually comes from the kingdom of Lydia (part of present-day Turkey), where the first coins were minted around the seventh century B.C. The kingdom became rich from these coins made from electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver, that was abundant in the river Pactole. Croesus was the last and most famous of the kings of Lydia. Pactole and Croesus entered into legend, and are used in modern parlance to symbolise wealth. We chose the name ""Lydia"" as a playful nod from modern techology to the entire history of money. A team of experts. Thanks to our first-class banking partners, we can assure a high level of security. We select the French leaders to work with...Lydia is a mobile app that lets you pay instantly using your phone. Lydia is designed and verified in France according to the highest standards of banking and IT security. Asymmetrical RSA keys, symmetrical 256-bit data encryption, SSL communications, personal data anonymisation... All of that, because we can never be too careful when it comes to money and personal information.",,,,

At Mapillary we want to create an image representation of the world, a map with images of every place on Earth.   Current street view alternatives have so many limitations from the fact that they are created using cars with camera rigs, focusing on streets. There are many places on this planet that they will never get to, and even the places they do get to will not get updated as often as you might want them to. Together we can fix that. In order to build this globally, we need your help! If your neighborhood or town is missing street view, go out and map it with Mapillary. If your business has no street view, take images of it and the roads leading there with Mapillary. If you want to share your favorite hike or bike ride, map it with Mapillary. We are committed to making the most out of every single upload and creating the best possible experience with your contributions.   Take images. Take lots of images. There is no limit to the level of detail you can add or the places you can go. Don t take tens of images, take hundreds or thousands at a time. The more the better. Our servers can handle it, your phone can handle it. The time is right. We are now at a point in time where the tools and infrastructure to make this happen are widely available. Phones have great cameras, good GPS, and enough storage to hold thousands of high quality images. Internet connectivity for uploading these images is widespread. Large scale compute infrastructure is available and scalable to mind boggling levels.   Here are some good examples that show what a decent amount of images can do, all crowdsourced from real people like you. Malm√∂, Davos, Venice Beach, Bj√§rred, Dresden.

Micro Focus IDOL, a search and analytics engine that delivers actionable intelligence from structured and unstructured data. Within the first 18 months, the system helped Dubai Police capture over 2,700 individuals. Zenith Gulf Security Systems began working with the Dubai Police in 2007, when Zenith first approached the police to introduce a new mobile ANPR solution. Previously, an officer with a printed list of wanted plates would comb through parking lots and garages full of cars and occasionally find a match. Now they have instant access to the latest data. Due to the success of ANPR, the Dubai Police has since expanded their capability with version 2 of the system, which offers an even wider range of detection for wanted plates and incorporates 360 degree video surveillance, all embedded discretely in the patrol car s roof-mounted light bar. Challenge To significantly improve effectiveness, the Dubai Police needed to automate the identification process through the use of technology. The system needed to work day and night and read a wide range of number plate styles within the seven Emirates of the UAE, which incorporate both English and Arabic lettering and different color codes. They also needed the ability to find and track wanted vehicles in moving traffic, but ensure up-to-the-minute data updates so only those still wanted would be ID d. Solution Real-time Response on Busy City Streets ""This technology combines high-end cameras and Micro Focus IDOL, which enables capturing an enormous amount of raw data rapidly and making sense of it almost instantly. And this system had to be extremely user-friendly for law enforcement; they can t be bogged down with hard-to-use technology on the job,"" says Russell Hammad, CEO of Zenith Gulf Security Systems, which developed the ANPR system. The original ANPR system featured a readily visible pan-tilt camera device mounted above a patrol car s light bar. It was designed primarily for scanning parked cars in garages and lots, but was also capable of scanning license plates immediately in front or behind a moving patrol car. The new system (which they rolled out in 2015) provides a more visually subtle integration of 12 cameras into the light bar, along with the ability to read license plates up to three lanes to the right or left of a patrol car, even at high traffic speeds. ""The display on the officer s dashboard shows a picture of the suspect vehicle as well as the highlighted plate data, plus a voice message as part of the alert,"" says Hammad. ""A screen comes up, shows you the image of the car, as well as all relevant records pertaining to the vehicle and why it has been identified."" Respecting, and Protecting, the Citizens of Dubai In determining requirements for the original ANPR system, Dubai Police wanted to ensure frequent updates to the data replicated to patrol cars, which only carry the license plate data for wanted vehicles; the main IDOL repository is maintained at headquarters. ""The deltas are downloaded to patrol cars every three minutes, so that drivers who were, say, delinquent in paying a fine or fee at 8:00 a.m., but have taken care of the charges at 10:00 a.m., will not be pulled over needlessly later in the day,"" says Hammad. ""People don t want to be inconvenienced, and the Dubai Police want this system to be well-received. As the main database is updated, the patrol cars get updated‚Äîalmost in real time."" On the other side of this equation, the Dubai Police are a renowned security apparatus in the UAE. To assist patrol units during emergencies, Zenith designed a push function to alert police regarding vehicles that have suddenly become wanted. ""For example, if there s a robbery and the getaway car has been ID d, the license information is immediately pushed out to all patrol cars along with any image of the vehicle, including a GPS coordinate of where the ID was made,"" says Hammad. The Heat Is On Creating the ANPR system involved more than the interface of IDOL with display screens inside police cars. Placing a sensitive camera system on top of a police car creates a high- heat issue, especially in Dubai, where the sun can cause a car s rooftop temperatures to go as high 60-70 degrees Celsius (140-150 degrees Fahrenheit). ""So, in every camera there s a dual camera optic system for redundancy and failover,"" explains Hammad. ""These are high quality cameras suited for what s called an IP-68 environment; they are very insulated for the temperature conditions."" Results ""Being able to connect in real time, and being able to respond in real time, is what this is all about,"" says Hammad. ""The Dubai Police are very forward thinking. They see the vision, and because they are known as leaders in municipal security, we have a number of other police forces in the region who are keenly discussing similar implementations of this technology."" With advanced cameras at the ready, Facial Recognition has become a new area of interest for this system‚Äîand given IDOL s abilities to connect to video and other visual data systems on a large scale, and to deliver high performance video and image analytics, this is something Zenith is beginning to explore. ""This is no longer a simple ANPR system. With version 2, Micro Focus IDOL s integrated analytics can help us go beyond license plates with its extensive support for video, sensors, text, and audio data. The ability to leverage, say, sentiment analysis of social media data, will allow us to more effectively uncover and respond to suspicious behaviors and pertinent information in a much more efficient manner. It s truly impressive what can be done to capitalize on all this data,"" says Hammad.

The future of air travel: Providing seamless, secure and efficient solutions for airports, airlines and governments across the globe. As many as 8.2 billion passengers will travel in 2037, a near doubling today s air passenger volume according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). When travelling, the customer journey and experience is often as important as the destination itself. However, increasing numbers of travelers also elevates the need for balancing efficient passenger processing with enhanced security measures. Airports and airlines are increasingly recognizing the need to adopt new strategies to proactively enable capacity growth, as well as lower operational costs, identify new revenue streams and ease passenger flow to enhance the overall travel experience. NEC is at the forefront of providing seamless, secure and efficient solutions for airports, airlines and governments across the globe to ultimately deliver an enhanced air traveler experience. Seamless Passenger Experience A passenger s information is stored on a single record, creating a trusted identity token for use at every in-airport touchpoint. Airport Security NEC s AI-based intelligent video analytics solutions ensure high quality ambient security. Airport Operations NEC s solutions are designed to enhance operational efficiencies in the face of increasing air passenger volumes. Air Traffic Control In order to efficiently manage air traffic, NEC offers an integrated Air Traffic Control System for en route and terminal air traffic. INTELLIGENTLY SECURE YOUR FACILITY. According to IATA s Global Passenger Survey 2017, passengers have identified airport security as one of their top two pain points. As airports become larger, busier and more sophisticated, so also must the security systems which are deployed, as traditional human and CCTV camera monitoring alone are no longer sufficient to ensure  safety and security within an airport. NEC has a 50-year history of providing next-generation security solutions to airports, and currently offers a variety of solutions which can intelligently secure your facility.  Some of our most recent innovations include behavior detection, crowd behavior analysis and enhanced video analytics. Behavior Detection LEARN FROM THE BEHAVIOR. NEC s behavior detection solution improves security reaction times by unobtrusively monitoring and reporting incidents within an airport. Our solution uses image recognition technology which can immediately identify and alert security personnel of incidents as they happen. Our system can loitering, sudden crowd formation, left objects, fallen people and unauthorized intrusions. Deploying this solution can significantly reduce the need for manual video feed monitoring and minimizes the chance of human error. Crowd Behavior Analysis GET BETTER CROWD CONTROL NEC s crowd behavior analysis solution offers real-time insights around crowd movement and density levels. Unusual crowd movements and a sudden rise in crowd levels, automatically generate alerts to warn security personnel. This empowers security operators to improve staffing efficiency and dynamically allocate resources for high priority tasks, improving checkpoint efficiency and reducing overall waiting times. NEC Enhanced Video Analytics NEC s Enhanced Video Analytics can help airport operators intelligently manage the extremely large amount of video footage which much be constantly monitored.  NEC Enhanced Video Analytics unites many of NEC s core technologies and services such as NeoFace Face Recognition and Behavior detection and also has added functions such as demographic and people counting and object recognition capabilities. All of these functionalities combined can help airport operators maintain a safe and secure environment. A SEAMLESS CURB-TO-GATE EXPERIENCE. According to the International Air Transport Association s 2019 Global Passenger Survey many aspects of the customer airport journey are lacking in terms of customer satisfaction.  Among the lowest-ranked airport customer experiences in terms of satisfaction include immigration (64%), security (66%) and bag drop (73%). NEC s technology supports this digital transformation by enabling a passenger s biometrics and travel information to be captured on a single record. This can then be used as a trusted token to identify the passenger to each stakeholder easily, eliminating the need for repetitive identity checks and ensuring process efficiencies at every touchpoint of the airport experience. New biometric technology available to passengers creates a better airport user experience and enables a fast and hassle-free journey from the curb side to the boarding gate. Passengers increasingly desire a comfortable travel experience when selecting an airline and an airport, which can be accomplished with biometric authentication. NEC s seamless passenger processing solution can be deployed across the entire passenger journey including at check-in, bag drop, security, immigration, lounge entry, retail stores and boarding. Face Recognition. World-leading Face Recognition for Multiple Industries. NEC s biometric face recognition technology is used worldwide for fighting crime, preventing fraud, securing public safety, and improving customer experience across a vast range of locations and industries. Why? Because independent NIST testing has repeatedly confirmed NEC s NeoFace recognition and matching capability as the world s fastest and most accurate across all benchmarks and challenging conditions.* It stems from over Half-century of biometric technology expertise. It couples recognition with real-time identification, verification and situation analysis for quick decision-making, preemptive security, and smoother services. Installed in over 1,000 major systems in more than 70 countries and regions worldwide, it boasts a stellar track record and wealth of practical experience. And finally, as the long-reputed industry leader, our face recognition solutions are also designed to offer solid protection for the public without encroaching on their privacy, freedoms or human rights. NEC, the Pioneer of Scalable Biometrics Border controls, airlines, airports, transport hubs, stadiums, mega events, concerts, conferences. Biometrics are playing a growing role not only in the real-time policing and securing of increasingly crowded and varied venues worldwide, but also in ensuring a smooth, enjoyable experience for the citizens who visit them. As a long-time committed pioneer of biometric research and solutions, NEC has developed multi-modal technologies including face, iris and voice recognition, finger- and palmprint identification, and ear acoustic authentication, and supplemented them with AI and data analytics to enhance situational awareness and facilitate effective real-time or post-event action in both law-enforcement and consumer-oriented spheres. Face recognition can often prove one of the best biometrics because images can be taken without touching or interacting with the individual being identified, and those images recorded and instantly checked against existing databases. NEC s face recognition offers high-performance, scalable solutions for the most demanding real-time or post-event requirements. With face surveillance, search, identification and verification functions all on a single platform, it can be easily integrated into existing surveillance systems to extract faces in real time, match against an existing database or watchlist and produce real-time alerts to help reduce public safety risks. With the ability to process and analyze multiple camera feeds and thousands of faces per minute, NEC s powerful face recognition is able to police the largest and most difficult security challenges with unparalleled efficiency, sensitivity, and perception. World-best Speed and Accuracy (NIST) The superior strength of NEC s face recognition technology lies in its outstanding tolerance of poor quality and conditions. This tolerance has repeatedly secured the top slot for NEC s technology range in independent tests conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States*, which declare our face recognition technology the most accurate in situations of varying levels of difficulties that reflect real life scenarios, with the fastest matching capability that is the most resistant to variants in angle and age. But just how good is NEC s face recognition technology in real life? NEC s technology can match a subject s face from images with resolutions as low as 24 pixels, even if the subject is on the move, or the face partially concealed by hats, scarves or glasses, or head angle. It also facilitates video surveillance of suspects in crowded, poorly lit areas at unmatched speed and volume in real time. NEC s face recognition technology does this by using long-tested algorithms that convert two-dimensional images into three-dimensional head images, which are then rotated in all directions and scrutinized using different vantage points, lighting situations, facial expressions and changes to help guarantee over 99% face-recognition accuracy in real-world situations. NEC Face Recognition in Action In response to booming demand for varied biometrics, NEC has expanded its traditional range of face recognition applications from law-enforcement and security provision to new areas, and now boasts more than 1,000 active systems in over 70 countries and regions spanning police department, immigration control agency, national ID, banking, entertainment, stadium, conference venue systems, and many more. Right now, many of our face recognition technology solutions are blazing a trail for first-time use in new areas and venues worldwide, such as end-to-end airport travel experiences in the U.S., mega event surveillance in Japan, and EU Summit security in Europe. In 2019, NEC was named Frost & Sullivan Asia Pacific Biometrics Company of the Year in recognition of its leading position in the industry and foresight in innovating and developing future face recognition biometric solutions that maximize customer value and experience. Balancing security and privacy As the leading global pioneer of face recognition and other biometric technologies, and champion of our NEC Safer Cities Vision, NEC is fully vested in developing biometric recognition solutions and services that contribute to the creation of safe, secure, equal and efficient communities around the world. Having positioned safety business as one of our key pillars of growth, we are keen to encourage businesses, consumers, and governments to work together to help balance the need for privacy with the benefits of protecting our society, securing our borders and providing consumer convenience without the fear of negative consequences. At NEC, we strongly believe that face recognition can add significant value to our lives, and we seek to advance these technologies in ways that respect the worldwide principals of freedom, justice, rights to privacy, transparency and continuous improvement. Biometric Authentication Realizing a safe and secure world with digital technology. Although society has become drastically convenient with digital technology, there are increased risks such as impersonation. This is why biometric authentication technology has become critical. NEC is the global leader in the field of biometric authentication. We started the R&D of biometrics authentication technologies such as fingerprint recognition, palmprint recognition and face recognition in the 1970s. At present, in addition to the above-mentioned technologies, NEC has developed iris recognition, voice recognition, as well as our original ear acoustic authentication technology. NEC s unique and highly accurate biometric authentication technology solutions are deployed worldwide. NEC uses these biometric technologies under the ""Bio-IDiom"" brand in various applications and in effective combinations to realize a world where ""anyone can utilize digital contents safely and securely.""

Large-scale Biometric Solutions Biometric for Integrators Biometrics for End Users Biometric Scanners Video Surveillance Computer Vision Robotics & A.I. Ultrasound technologies. PROPRIETARY ALGORITHMS AND TECHNOLOGIES SINCE 1990. TECHNOLOGY AWARDS IN INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS. MILLIONS OF ALGORITHM DEPLOYMENTS WORLDWIDE. 500+ human-years of R&D experience. Technology proven in national-scale projects. Flexible licensing, transparent pricing. Unlimited, free technical support. COMPANY INFORMATION: Neurotechnology was founded in Vilnius, Lithuania in 1990 with the key idea of using neural networks for applications such as biometric person identification, computer vision, robotics and artificial intelligence. Much to our delight, we were able to endure the ""neural networks winter"" by using and expanding this expertise all through 2012, the year that brought explosive developments in the concept and infrastructure of deep neural networks. This allowed us to quickly take advantage of the emerging opportunities that came with the new wave of deep learning and triggered an entire range of new projects in object recognition and other applications. Currently, our team is comprised of more than 100 employees, 15% of whom hold a Ph.D. and half of our employees are actively involved in R&D activities. NEURAL NETWORKS AND AI In almost 30 years of our activity, we have accumulated substantial experience in the area of neural networks. This allowed us to develop a multitude of product capabilities based on deep learning as well as customer applications. Deep neural networks are able to solve many problems - such as image classification, object detection, or instance segmentation - more efficiently than traditional computer vision algorithms. To facilitate this process, we have built a technology that has tools to support developing AI-based object recognition applications. In the area of face recognition, the last few years witnessed a dramatic reduction in error rates brought by new algorithms that are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our company started using CNNs for the task of face recognition in 2013. The first application of neural networks alone resulted in an improvement in the accuracy of unconstrained face recognition by a factor of 15 times! We expect further improvements in face recognition performance due to explosive development of architectures and techniques related to CNNs. As deep learning techniques kept proliferating other areas, we were ultimately able to employ our face recognition algorithms under the conditions of real-time surveillance. By being able to recognize and track other objects - such as pedestrians and all kinds of vehicles (cyclists, bikes, cars, busses, trucks, etc.) - in adjacent video frames, we can extract various pieces of information about those objects, for example the color of the vehicle or the direction of its movement. There is a separate modality for recognizing license plates of vehicles using neural networks. Our latest improvements in other biometric modalities are also driven by extensive research in deep neural networks. This includes the most interoperable fingerprint algorithm in the world (ranked the first in the NIST MINEX interoperability category), the second most accurate iris recognition technology and the new version of our algorithm for speaker identification. As another illustration of our achievements in using deep learning, Neurotechnology s researchers won first place in the 2017 Kaggle competition with a computer vision solution for classifying fish species. We seek to distill our knowledge and understanding of how natural intelligence operates into deep-learning-based algorithms, and we see this approach as the shortest path toward achieving General AI. Neurotechnology also runs Deep Learning Paper Reviews, a series of open-access events devoted to sharing and discussing recent ideas in the field. BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS We have a reputation for developing a range of products for biometric identification of fingerprints, palm prints, faces, irises and voices. Since the release of our first fingerprint identification system, we have delivered more than 200 products and version upgrades for identification and verification of objects and personal identity. Over 3,000 system integrators, security companies and hardware providers in more than 140 countries integrate our algorithms into their products. With a combination of fast algorithms and high reliability, our company s fingerprint, face, iris, voice and palmprint biometric technologies can be used for access control, computer security, banking, time attendance control and law enforcement applications, among others. With millions of customer installations worldwide, our products are used for both civil and forensic applications, including border crossings, criminal investigations, systems for voter registration, verification and duplication checking, passport issuance and other national-scale projects. Neurotechnology s fingerprint identification algorithms have shown top results for reliability in major biometric competitions and evaluations, including the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) Minutiae Interoperability Exchange III (MINEX III), Proprietary Fingerprint Template Evaluation II (PFT II) and Fingerprint Vendor Technology Evaluation for the US Department of Justice (FpVTE 2012). Previously, the fingerprint recognition algorithms have received awards in the International Fingerprint Verification Competitions (FVC2006, FVC2004, FVC2002 and FVC2000). In 2018, our iris recognition algorithm was tested in the NIST Iris Exchange (IREX) Evaluation and was recognized as the second most accurate among those tested. The accelerated version of the algorithm was nearly 50 times faster than any other matching system in the NIST IREX IX evaluation. Previously, Neurotechnology showed outstanding results in the IREX, IREX III and IREX IV evaluations. In 2019 our palm print matching algorithm has shown the top result at the FVC-onGoing evaluation, being the most accurate overall and fastest among the five most accurate matchers. COMPUTER VISION To meet the demands of a variety of applications, we developed many advanced algorithms based on computer vision. For instance, they are used in SentiSight.ai, our interactive web platform for developing AI-based object recognition applications. The platform has tools designed to support interactive model training - without coding - and faster image labeling, thus reducing the amount of user effort spent on data mining. We also run projects tailored to the specific needs of our customers. Our technology for real-time surveillance was designed to support biometric face identification of moving pedestrians using live video streams from high-resolution digital cameras. The technology is used for passive identification, when passers-by do not make any efforts to be recognized. Possible uses for this technology include law enforcement, security, attendance control, visitor counting, traffic monitoring and other commercial applications. Some of our ealier R&D efforts related to computer vision also involved technologies for eye movement tracking and 3D object model reconstruction. ROBOTICS Our current R&D effort in robotics is focused on the ""programming by demonstration"" approach and its practical implementation in various neural network structures. During our experiments we not only gained experience with different types of neural networks (e.g., various CNN s, RNN s, including RNN s with external memory, the self modifying RNN and the CMP, Cognitive Mapping and Planning), we also developed our own theoretical innovations. SentiBotics, our ready-to-use robotics development kit, allows rapid development and testing of mobile robots. The kit includes a mobile robotic platform with a 3D vision system, a modular robotic arm and accompanying ROS-based software we have built on our own, with complete source code and programming samples. ULTRASOUND RESEARCH GROUP Our Ultrasound Research Group undertakes research in the fields of ultrasonic particle manipulation, parametric array and transducer technology. It develops novel algorithms, hardware and electronics solutions for ultrasonics applications. Currently, the group is developing a new, patent-pending 3D printing and assembling technology based on ultrasonic particle manipulation. This new technology is intended to expand capabilities of existing 3D printing and assembling processes. In 2018, the group also filed a patent for a novel ultrasonic electrostatic transducer technology. These transducers were developed primarily for use in parametric array systems. In 2019, Focusonics directional speaker, based on the patent-pending method of using ultrasonic waves to reproduce sound, was introduced.

From Telcos to Banks to Insurers to the Internet of Things, millions of people, apps and devices rely on next generation multi factor authentication solutions from Nok Nok Labs. Nok Nok, headquartered in San Jose, CA, was founded in November 2011 in order to unify the silos that are currently unable to meet authentication needs for modern computing. Nok Nok is the market leader in next generation authentication for cloud, mobile and IoT applications. The company s carrier-grade, web-scale authentication platform has been deployed to hundreds of millions of users through leading Mobile Network Operators, Fintech, Banking, Healthcare and IoT customers. Through the Nok Nok S3 Authentication Suite, the company provides the security and assurance of ""right user, right device and right context"" to realize frictionless delivery of services for superior customer experiences. The company is a pioneer in driving the adoption of passwordless next generation authentication that includes biometric, token or wearable-based authentication of devices and users on mobile, PC & IoT platforms to deliver strong, multi-factor authentication. Nok Nok is trusted by millions of users and by leading Fortune 500 enterprises everyday to connect, engage, transact with and service their customers to provide a secure and confident omni-channel digital experience. Nok Nok is a privately held company and is based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 2012 by a team of security industry veterans from companies such as PGP, PayPal, Phoenix, ValiCert, Sun Microsystems and Netscape with the vision that authentication lies at the heart of the security problem for every computing ecosystem.  Solving this problem requires us overcome the limitations of legacy authentication solutions such as passwords and OTPs (one-time-passwords). Those methods are subject to scalable attacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks that can be done remotely and be automated to cause maximum damage.  Nok Nok s innovations deliver plug and play authentication solutions that are simple, secure and scalable for three key constituencies ‚Äì end users, developers and IT support personnel. Nok Nok is the author of several key industry standards ratified by bodies such as the FIDO Alliance and the W3C. The company s innovation and IP extends well beyond its contribution to the standards community.  The Nok Nok team is sought after to consult and comment at industry forums and conferences and to regulatory bodies worldwide on best practices related to Identity & Authentication across many industries and are a trusted advisor to their customers. Why Authentication. Authentication is the weakest link in the chain of cyber security. Every year billions of dollars are invested in securing business through legacy authentication solutions such as password management, one-time passwords or fraud/risk management systems and firewall/VPN/intrusion systems. Beyond their costs, these systems create friction in customer interactions and complexity for IT and have proven ineffective against attacks on credentials. Despite the large investments, according to the 2017 Verizon Data Breach Incident Report, 81% of the reported data breaches were caused by a stolen or compromised credentials. These credentials themselves are used to mount attacks that have catastrophic consequences for brands, their customers and potentially for the ecosystems they participate in. To truly secure any computing ecosystem and prevent scalable attacks we need a modern way to secure our credentials that is simple, secure and scalable. The company is the visionary behind and one of the five founders of the FIDO Alliance, an industry group leading efforts to standardize password-less and multi-factor authentication. FIDO is changing how the world will authenticate in 21st century digital economy and is increasingly referenced by standards and regulatory bodies.  Nok Nok s innovations go beyond the limitations of individual authentication methods to deliver a framework approach that allows a plug-and-play approach to authentication. The company is an industry leader that innovates on top of a standards-based platform and has real-world deployments in the millions of users. Mobile Network Operators: Unlock new services and increase customer satisfaction with modern mobile authentication solutions.

Introducing Nymi Enterprise EditionTM Weak passwords, shared credentials, and lost badges all challenge the integrity of data in complex manufacturing facilities. Nymi Enterprise Edition enhances security, which leads to improved data integrity and thus allows an enterprise to meet its compliance mandate all while increasing productivity. Protected Data Integrity: Nymi Enterprise Edition is able to assure the integrity of the data being produced on the manufacturing floor through a combination of biometrics, on‚Äëbody detection, and strong industry-standard cryptography. Assured Compliance: Only the right employees can perform the right tasks, at the right times, for the right reasons. Nymi Enterprise Edition provides guaranteed data integrity that assures compliance with standards, such as FDA 21 CFR Part 11. Enhanced Security: A Nymi Band authenticates to a single assigned user, and only while they wear the band. Nymi Enterprise Edition provides easy traceability and non-repudiable electronic records, which makes simplier, less intrusive audits a reality. Increased Productivity: Secure, non-repudiable, wireless taps of the Nymi Band make cumbersome repetitive tasks, like typing passwords and paper signatures a thing of the past. Always On AuthenticationTM: Authentication is only required once at the beginning of a shift, completes in a matter of seconds, and persists until the operator removes the Nymi Band. Enterprise Ready: The back-end server and services required by Nymi Enterprise Edition are standard Microsoft products and are designed to be compatible with enterprise IT architecture. No modifications to Active Directory are required. Nymi provides a simple administrative interface for managing users and their Nymi Bands. Seamless Integrations: The Nymi SDK allows for integration with third-party software solutions, such as SSO, IAM, MES, and HMI. Deployment of the Nymi Enterprise Server at any site is seamless, quick, and easy, leveraging existing identity infrastructure. The Challenge:  Current enterprise authentication solutions are weak and broken. Usernames and passwords, smart cards, and PINs are all cumbersome, insecure authentication methods that are easily lost, shared, or stolen. An enterprise s most vital information is at constant risk of exploitation. Data integrity is questionable. Compliance concerns increase. Productivity diminishes. Costs rise.  Complex infrastructures like those on a manufacturing production line and tight controls make change prohibitive. Changing authentication solutions frequently entails weighing trade-offs between security and productivity, or implementing a solution that doesn t meet the compliance requirements set forth by governing bodies, thus risking fines and escalating costs.  Current Authentication Solutions = Weak Security = Questionable Data Integrity = Compliance Violations = Expensive Fines. Nymi realizes that changing authentication solutions cannot result in trade-offs between data integrity, security, compliance, and productivity. Each critical success factor goes hand-in-hand.  Nymi Enterprise Edition combines a highly secure, wearable device with an easily deployed enterprise software solution, to provide the world s strongest authentication solution to enterprises that are highly regulated, compliance driven, and place a high value on data integrity.  Nymi Enterprise Edition = Tighter Security = Assured Data Integrity = Simplified Compliance Audits = Improved Operational Efficiency. Nymi Enterprise Edition for Industrial IoT Applications: Pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries that deploy the Nymi authentication solution provide employees with a quick and easy way to achieve compliance and security standards without compromising productivity. Nymi Enterprise Edition is an industry-leading solution that makes audits simpler and less intrusive by ensuring uncompromised data integrity, traceability, and non-repudiation of a company s electronic records. Quality Statement  Nymi has implemented a Quality Management System (QMS) that aligns with our customer requirements and guides the development of products and solutions in compliance with GAMP5 (Good Automated Manufacturing Practice) guidelines by looking at the pharmaceutical manufacturing process as a whole. Nymi develops products and solutions with high traceability to ensure data integrity and security is maintained throughout the pharmaceutical manufacturing lifecycle.  To support our customer needs, we tailor our solutions to enable seamless integration and a structured qualification and validation approach which is in line with regulatory requirements and the GAMP5 recommendations. Additional documentation and guides are provided to support implementation and system validation into GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) environments to ensure pharmaceutical products are consistently produced, according to defined quality standards, every single time. Our Story: Assuring the human shouldn t be hard. It shouldn t be hard for you or your team, but it is. Today s solutions are incomplete and fall short of ensuring that you have the proper people performing the actions that the business intended. Weak passwords, shared credentials, and lost badges all challenge the integrity of data. Nymi builds security solutions that enable companies to be more secure, compliant and productive. Our solution allows employees to wear their credentials and authorize actions securely. Nymi currently works with the Top 100 companies in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing. Wondering how we got here?  Nymi was founded in 2011 in Toronto, Canada, based on research conducted at the University of Toronto. The research was focused on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and its unique properties. The ECG is different for each individual, and our founding team worked to use the heartbeat as a biometric identifier for authentication.  Initially, Nymi (Bionym at the time) was focused on licensing this technology to third-parties and OEMs to replace passwords in hardware devices. Over time, the team identified the need not just to improve or replace existing tools of authentication, but to create a completely new model of authentication: continuous, on-body authentication.  To bring this concept to market, it became necessary to develop dedicated authentication hardware. This served as the foundation of what was to become Nymi (December of 2014), and our enterprise authentication solution, Nymi Enterprise Edition.",,,,

Creating a Safe and Secure Society with High-Precision Facial Recognition Systems Using the world s highest level of facial recognition accuracy developed using deep learning technology to make security monitoring and management more efficient As use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly expands, a wide range of information is beginning to be linked together in diverse industries to make our lifestyles more convenient. At Panasonic, particularly in the field of security, deep learning technology using AI is integrated with intelligent camera technology and video monitoring software to advance the technical development and implementation of facial recognition systems. The World s Highest Level of Facial Recognition Accuracy Facial recognition systems can be effectively utilized in the field of security monitoring and management. Facial recognition can be applied to a variety of solutions: from identifying terrorists, suspicious persons, shoplifters and dangerous people, to expediting access to secure facilities. Panasonic has been engaged in the technical development of security camera systems for more than 60 years, constantly staying on top of the needs of those at the front lines of the field. Panasonic began R&D of image sensing technology close to 30 years ago, developed the LUMIX brand of digital cameras, and also started sales of facial recognition systems paired with our security cameras in 2011, thus accumulating a considerable track record and expertise in the field. Recently, as interest in the field of security has increased together with rapid changes in social conditions, in August 2018 Panasonic launched its high-precision facial recognition system ""FacePRO"" with deep learning technology, which combines security and image sensing technologies. The recognition engine of this system was developed together with the National University of Singapore ‚Äî one of Asia s leading academic institutes, which conducts cutting-edge research on deep learning technology. The system has been certified as the world s highest level of facial recognition performance*1 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a leading standards institute of the United States. *1 Having achieved the world s highest level of facial recognition performance, as certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States (as of April 2017) in a comparison test (IJB-A Face Verification Challenge Performance Report, IJB -A Face Identification Challenge Performance Report). Even with ""1:n"" Verification, High Recognition Accuracy Is Achieved There are two types of facial recognition: ""1:1"" (one to one) verification using one s face to match against a photo ID such as a passport; and ""1:n"" (one to many) verification which matches a target individual s face from within a number of unspecified people. The Panasonic facial recognition system uses a unique algorithm that combines a machine learning method based on deep learning and a similarity calculation method that suppresses errors. Even in the event of ""1:n"" verification, the facial features are extracted to greatly improve the recognition performance.*2 Highly precise verification can identify faces that are difficult to recognize with conventional technologies, including faces at an angle of up to 45 degrees to the left or right or 30 degrees up or down, and those partially hidden by a surgical mask or sunglasses. High-precision verification is also achieved with aging changes (recognizing faces that have changed over the years and with different hair styles). *2 Improves facial recognition performance by up to 500% compared to conventional systems. (Rejection rate reduced to 20% when the wrong person acceptance rate is set to 0.01 with the IJB-A face image dataset.) From Passive to Active Use: Preventing Incidents and Accidents Compared with conventional security systems, which are often just used to confirm events after they have occurred ‚Äî such as to use recorded images as evidence ‚Äî this system distinguishes the facial image of persons who require attention in advance. It can also be used to determine whether those persons are still present by conducting searches in real time. This allows users to actively prevent incidents and accidents, or leads to the quick discovery of such, all while helping to make security monitoring more efficient and increase safety and security. Reducing the Server and Network Loads With ordinary facial recognition systems, all of the captured images are sent to a server, and facial detection and recognition occurs within the server, which places all the data processing burden on the server. In addition, because a wide bandwidth is required to send the high volume of images, and a large-capacity hard disk drive (HDD) is needed to store them, the system typically tends to be large-scale. With FacePRO, the camera crops only the images (""Best Shot"") that are necessary for facial recognition from all the facial images recorded of the same person passing in front of a camera, and sends only those best shots to the server. As the camera bears part of the large image analysis processing load typically done by the server, and because only the images that are best suited to facial recognition are sent, there is less data transmission required by the network. This reduces the server load to approximately 1/5th that of a conventional system, and reduces the network load to approximately 1/10th. Compared to a conventional system that does not use this function, a 40-50% reduction in the overall system costs can be achieved. Integrated Management with an Existing System With Panasonic s ""i-PRO Monitoring System"" for instance, because integrated operation is possible with the existing system, the need to operate and manage a completely separate facial recognition system is eliminated, and the work can all be centralized in an integrated system. For example, when doing a target person search, which is an important part of a crime prevention monitoring system, by searching for a designated person, information on when and where that person appeared, which direction they were headed, and where the person presently is, can all be shown on a single monitoring screen in a timeline. The facial detection, facial verification, and tracking of captured images from the recorder are all done on one graphical user interface (GUI), enabling one-stop integrated management. This ability to provide each necessary component, from cameras to entire systems, is a strength offered only by Panasonic. Facial recognition systems not only streamline security monitoring and management work, but they can also be used for marketing applications. Panasonic participates in demonstration projects in a variety of fields and deploys products and systems for both consumer and enterprise use. Moving forward, we will continue to offer cutting-edge image technologies and integrated management as easy-to-use solutions to meet our customers  needs. Sustainability Initiatives: Environment, Society, Corporate Citizenship Activities. Facial Recognition: FacePRO:Panasonic Facial Recognition System. Panasonic FacePRO can identify faces that are difficult to recognize within common video surveillance technology. These situations include reading faces at an angle of up to 45 degrees to the left or right or 30 degrees up or down, with a 90% accuracy rate when detecting faces partially hidden by sunglasses or face masks. FacePRO also has high accuracy reads in matching faces taken from up to ten-year-old passport images. -Specific faces can be registered in advance to send an alarm when they are detected. The faces of repeat shoplifters and wanted criminals,etc. can be registered in the facial recognition security/surveillance system from data recorded in the past. Information can also be shared between facial recognition systems by importing generic photo data in the JPEG format, etc. Alarms can notify the operator by displaying pop-ups on the screen, emitting warning sounds, or flashing the camera on the map, etc. -Face images can be used to perform searches. For example, face images of suspicious people detected on the sales floor can be searched to track information on a timeline, including what time they entered the store and which sales floor they passed. Whether suspicious people have shoplifted, etc. after entering the store can also be immediately searched for and checked by the facial recognition security/surveillance system ""FacePRO"". Case Study - Since October 18, 2017, three units of Panasonic s facial recognition gate have been put into operation at Tokyo International Airport s immigration control. Without the need for prior registration of biometric data, the system compares photographic data of the traveler s face in the IC chip embedded in the person s passport with a photo taken at the facial recognition gate to verify the identity. - Jumbo Ten Brink Food Stores in the Netherlands installed Panasonic security cameras and a facial recognition server as part of their commitment to their  zero tolerance shoplifting policy.  - Avid football fans gather at stadiums across Europe, but sometimes that enthusiasm can turn to dangerous behavior. See how Panasonic s facial recognition system helps to solve this problem. FacePRO Main Features: Face Matching Registered Face Detection, One of the major advantages of the Facial Recognition Solution is the level of control it gives you from a central point of management. Thanks to the direct connection between camera and server, you can control and gather insight from up to 20 remote cameras from one server, at the same time. With face matching and visual analysis carried out by the system in real time, your operator can easily access any recorded images related to that face or customer, via the GUI in their monitoring software. - When it is matched with registered people, alarm of face matching is output in real-time, and display an alarm history in the list. - Specified screen image can be played back on control monitor with double-clicking on an alarm history. Unregistered Face Detection (New Feature): Real-time detection of people who are NOT registered. -The Facial Recognition Server Software(Ver2.0 or later) shall set registered face detection or unregistered face detection* in a facial recognition server. *Unregistered face detection setting can be used both of Unregistered Face Detection and Registered Face Detection simultaneously - The Facial Recognition Server Software in unregistered face detection setting shall connect up to 10 Panasonic i-PRO cameras with best shot function to a single server depends on the number of people passing and the retention period of the face image. - Facial Recognition Server Software in unregistered face detection setting shall be performed detection of unregistered face at three seconds collates with 30,000 registered faces after receiving the face thumbnail to facial recognition server. Face Search The facial recognition software runs silently in your system, collecting data on each face that it detects; this data is then stored within an easily accessible database. A user will then be able to access this database, and will be given the option to select a particular face. With this functionality, the user can choose to set an alarm to be sounded upon future detection of this subject, or simply track a particular person s movements in chronological order throughout all of the cameras in the system. - Face images that camera detected are stored, and it can be searched later. - By searching the face DB, you can display the result of each cameras in chronological order and find movement locus of persons. - Specify camera or date in detected face images and display the result in the list in similarity order. Face Registration Up to 30,000. People Counting, Age and Gender Statistics The software also features an analytics section. In this area, a user is given the ability to analyse statistics such as people counting, and also allows them to detect age and gender. The system will then display the relevant information in an accessible manner. - Count people of detected face and evaluate their age and gender. - Display the result on the screen with statistical graph. - The statistical data can be saved as a CSV file for analytical use. Benefit: High Precision - The deep learning technology used in the new software was jointly developed with the National University of Singapore and improves facial recognition performance by up to 500% compared to conventional systems. - A unique algorithm that combines deep learning, a machine learning method, with a similarity calculation method that suppresses errors, enables recognition in situations that were difficult with conventional facial recognition technology, such as when the face is angled (up to 45 degrees to the left or right or 30 degrees up or down), partially hidden with sunglasses or a surgical mask, or changed by aging. The camera automatically detects the moving objects, movement speed, faces, and light intensity (day/night/headlights) found in video that are usually hard to see due to subject movement and backlight, and optimizes the settings in real-time and capture more optimal video of the subject. - The Best Shot License Key included with this software can be installed on Panasonic i-PRO EXTREME series network cameras (sold separately) to automatically select the images suitable for facial recognition from the multiple face images captured when a person passes in front of the camera, and send only those selected images to the server. This enables high-quality images suitable for facial recognition to be sent without putting a load on the server. System Cost Reduction: - With conventional facial recognition systems, all captured images are sent to the server, and the server performs face detection and facial recognition, which concentrates the load of data processing on the server. Systems also tend to be large-scale because of the large bandwidth required to send all the images and the high capacity hard drive space required to save those images. - Using Panasonic s system that combines this product with cameras that include the iA function allows faces to be detected by the camera and only the Best Shot images that contain faces to be sent to the server, which dramatically decreases network load and eliminates the need for large bandwidth. Performing facial recognition on the server using the Best Shot images reduces server load and hard drive capacity requirements as well as permitting up to 20*6 network cameras to be connected to a single server. - With this Panasonic system, it is no longer necessary to send the data-intensive high resolution images to a server, unlike conventional systems. This delivers high-precision facial recognition while dramatically decreasing network traffic, transmission costs, and network construction costs. - When using Panasonic s system with 10 or more network cameras connected, costs can be reduced by about 40 to 50% compared to conventional systems that do not use the Best Shot function. System Expandability: Simple batch registration of a maximum of 10,000 faces is possible with the standard Facial Recognition Server Software (WV-ASF950). The optional Face Registration Expansion Kit (WV-ASFE951W) enables registration of up to 30,000 faces at large-scale facilities. Integrated management with i-PRO video surveillance system Face detection, facial recognition, and tracking with recorded video can be performed in the same GUI by performing integrated management with the WV-ASM300 or WV-ASE231W client software for Panasonic i-PRO video surveillance systems. This eliminates the need for the dedicated operation and management required for conventional facial recognition systems and enables work to be centralized.",,,,

Our goal is to empower the world with a digital identity system that puts individual privacy and data security first. Our identity system allows for a more secure, private, and convenient digital world. Privacy: We empower people by giving them control of their sensitive information and, in turn, allow our partners to effortlessly identify users and comply with modern privacy standards. Trust: We provide our partners and their users with delightful to use identity products, that enable people of all backgrounds to safely trust and transact with each other. Security: We are building a future where data breaches impacting the sovereignty of our identities are a thing of the past, by providing users with tools to securely share identity information with others. Meet the team: A group of creative technologists working together to solve open identity. Our Vision. Over the past ten years, there has been a massive erosion of personal privacy and data security. More than 6.2 billion consumer data points have been stolen in the United States and many of those data points represent details related to your identity. Usernames, passwords and social security numbers, to name a few. This is simply unacceptable and we believe it s time to give you back control over what is rightfully yours. Your identity information. Our goal is to empower the world with a digital identity system that puts individual privacy and data security first. This means giving individuals the power to decide with whom they share their personal information, and in turn, allow businesses to be certain about the identity of the people utilizing their services without collecting massive amounts of information about them. Our identity system allows for a more secure, private, and convenient digital world. This is why our team works tirelessly to build a world-class identity proofing solution that puts the individual back in control. From here, we will reimagine the future of identity, privacy, and security online through the combination of cutting-edge technologies driven by a world-class team, hungry for change. Our beliefs - Five things we believe to be true. 1 Identity is a huge problem. We believe that most sensitive identity information online is collected, stored, and lost because businesses need to verify the identity of people using their services. They do this in order to build trust with and between their users. This has caused a boom in the number of data breaches containing personal data and in turn an erosion of personal security and privacy. 2 Privacy is the future. We believe privacy and data ownership are important now, and will become increasingly more important, as more sensitive aspects of our lives shift online. This trend has accelerated with this mass adoption of mobile computing, the advent of IoT, and the digitization of the old economy. 3 Technology can solve it. We believe the technologies required to solve identity online while maintaining user privacy, now exist and can be combined into a valuable solution for businesses, consumers, and governments. We have the team, tools, and determination to combine these technologies into a solution that ensures data security and privacy for both business and consumers. 4 Big tech won t win. We believe the technology giants are NOT in a position to solve this problem. Many of their businesses are premised on collecting & monetizing personal data or mass distributing hardware. These ulterior motives make them poor candidates to solve identity and we believe it will take a new kind of company to pioneer this redistribution of power and data ownership. 5 This is a rebellion. We believe the world unconsciously sacrificed individual liberties and took on massive risk for the sake of convenient and personalized services. We are the team that will spark and lead a rebellion to resolve this. By building a foundation upon which others can build secure and convenient services, we will silently return the power and control back to people and unlock opportunities for new types of businesses that could never have existed before. Our Values - Our values and how we uphold them: These are the fundamental principles by which we live, work, and grow as a team. 1 Personal Ownership What this means to us We are all leaders and are empowered to make decisions. When things don t go the way we planned, we own it, understand it, and keep moving forward, stronger as one team. 2 Persistent Learning What this means to us We are more interested in learning than being right and believe no idea is too sacred to be questioned. We deeply value giving and receiving feedback, no matter rank or title. We leave it all on the dance floor. 3 Product Excellence What this means to us We craft experiences people remember and love. We aim to create products that integrate into daily life, changing it for the better. We are building something very powerful and with great power, comes great responsibility. 4 Power of Community What this means to us We make it a point to build an organization that is a reflection of the world, and not ourselves. We celebrate our differences and promise to always invest in each other s long term success and happiness.",,,,

No information about the user s face or pictures of the user are stored on the device or in the third-party cloud provider. Who supplies the speech recognition technology? Pillo Health uses a large cloud technology provider for its speech recognition capabilities.

No need for cloud computing services or extra computing accelerator cards to achieve real-time video analytics, hence lowering the overall system deployment costs. Simultaneous Multi-Channel Analytics QVR Face can simultaneously analyze multiple video streams and identify multiple registered profiles and unknown faces at the same time. You can use the video analytics results to create blacklists or VIP lists. Private Cloud Data Storage QVR Face s video analytics and registered profiles (including identified person s names and photos) are directly saved to on-premise storage. QNAP NAS also provides efficient data protection mechanism to ensure the privacy and security of the facial recognition data. Easy API Integration Third-party partners can leverage QVR Face s facial analytics data (including Event, Metadata Notify and Result) via API to enable automated service management, such as door access systems, member identification systems, or digital signage system. Identity Authentication Made Easy with Profile Database You can create facial recognition analytic tasks of live streams from cameras or recordings saved on the NAS in QVR Face. With the video analytics results, you can create profiles of identified persons, set groups (such as VIP groups, unregistered faces, or blacklists) and event notifications. The system will send alert notifications when a person meeting the configured facial identification rules is detected. (Facial identification rule conditions include a person s gender, age, and group category.) You can also check the video analytics report for history video analytics results. Note: For security and data privacy concerns, only NAS admin group members have permission to access and use the QVR Face application.

SINA - For the Highest IT Security Requirements One of the centrepieces of the secunet portfolio is SINA (Secure Inter-Network Architecture), a high-security solution that secunet developed on behalf of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). SINA is mainly used by clients of secunet s Public Authorities, Homeland Security and Defence divisions, and has taken on an increasingly important role in the Critical Infrastructures division. SINA products are used for the secure processing, storage, transmission and verification of classified and other sensitive information. The system works by strictly separating differently classified data. SINA solutions are scalable, designed for complex national, international and multinational infrastructures, and suitable formass roll-outs. The extensive product range - from tablets and other clients, through crypto gateways to Ethernet encoders - can be deployed in a wide range of application scenarios. Thanks to SINA Management, the individual SINA components can be flexibly configured, allowing the customer to retain sovereignty over cryptography and key management at all times. SINA is the only IP-based cryptographic system that is approved by the German Federal Office for Information Security up to security classification German SECRET, as well as for the international NATO SECRET and SECRET UE/EU SECRET levels. National and international authorities, the armed forces, and private companies which are subject to the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy s secret protection programme have successfully used SINA for many years. With nearly 100,000 installations in over 30 countries worldwide, the numbers speak for themselves. PKI: Public-Key-Infrastructures. secunet security infrastructure ‚Äì crucial for critical networks An ecosystem for secure networking and separation of critical networks. The aim is to isolate separated networks across sites and connect them to the ""outside world"" ‚Äì manufacturers, service providers, project partners ‚Äì via secure gateways and quarantine systems. At the same time, the established perimeter and protection devices in the network can be monitored intelligently and automatically in real time. The services provided by the secunet security infrastructure are based on generally applicable technical security architectures that are universally implemented in various industries. Both classic IT and industrial networks are served with appropriate individual characteristics. Biometrics: secunet is among the leading biometrics experts not only in Germany. For us, biometrics is far from being just another trending topic. Instead, we have been significantly involved in the successful implementation of biometric key projects in Europe for almost 20 years. We deal with the biometric registration and verification in the context of official identity documents as well as for the identity check and verification of persons, border control and passenger flow optimisation - from research, evaluation, piloting and product development to realisation. We are profoundly versatile when it comes to biometrics: Investments in long-term partnerships Cooperation on technical guidelines and standards Standard-compliant IT solutions and products Comprehensive consulting for future-proof solutions Research with consistent practical relevance. In close cooperation with the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), we develop standard-compliant products and IT solutions which have been internationally recognised as reference implementation. For example, the secunet biomiddle platform: As core component of many eID and biometrics applications, the middleware, takes over the flexible integration of the application-specific processes and controls the required software and hardware components via standard interfaces. secunet continuously supports and impacts the newest developments and technologies through an extensive network and active participation in international work groups. Our experts have contributed to over 50 technical guidelines and ISO standards in the area of biometrics and eIDs. As part of a transatlantic team, we are currently refining the NFIQ2 algorithm for the assessment of the quality of fingerprints.  Our holistic, standard-compliant products and IT solutions are used thousands of times every day. They simplify the registration and verification process of electronic and biometric identities and ensure the highest degree of security. We advise our customers about suitable and future-proof biometric modalities and protection mechanisms as well as about measures for handling sensitive biometric data. In doing so, we ensure that processes and solutions are aligned with the respective legal framework conditions, for example regarding data protection, and that such conditions are observed. Our experts continuously research even more secure processes for practical use. We deal with current, relevant questions: How must biometric algorithms and processes be designed so that the registered data do not allow for conclusions about a single person - even if the data should fall into unauthorised hands? Or how can we use artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning for anomaly detection and thereby increase the security of biometric systems against fraud?  Biometrics and eID Solutions by secunet: make any application modular and highly secure are always of high quality ""made in Germany"" guarantee low total cost of ownership are consistantly standard-compliant, hence flexible in use and globally interoperable always contain the latest insights from standardisation bodies. Secure IT-Infrastructure IT security is the backbone of every modern society. Anyone who does not know if their data and IT systems are adequately protected is playing a risky game. Secure IT infrastructures and workplaces, sophisticated security concepts, and clear-cut emergency plans are now vital prerequisites for all organisations, whether local or global. As a result, the IT security market is as varied and dynamic as its challenges. Over the last two decades, secunet has emerged as an innovative market leader in Germany and Europe, offering trusted, high-quality solutions and products in fields like applied cryptography, e-Government, business security and automotive security, all of which are designed to meet the complex challenges of today and tomorrow. Our services range from analysis and consulting, to the conception, development and integration of software and hardware solutions, as well as training and support.

This way, no photo or video of a person s face ever gets stored, eliminating all privacy concerns. SAVE TIME & MONEY: Smilart solutions are not only more precise and highly competitive in the FRT marketplace; but other, outdated technologies can be very costly and only become more costly with time. Maintenance, human capital, replacement, turnover, and ROI all factor into an organization s bottom line. Our system is our own. That means Smilart is a true vendor and no third party vendor costs get passed to the customer. Smilart technology is scalable, highly redundant, supported, dependable, extremely accurate, designed for long-term use, requires no maintenance, and does the work of several individuals with less room for error. Smilart significantly reduces cost and increases value that can be quantified, all while requiring less operating cost, less time, and less supervision. Launch and forget! WE ARE FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS: Our customers deal with a multitude of issues and face extremely complicated tasks each and every day, especially when it comes to the safety and security of their employees, customers and facilities. These environments leave no room for error and require utmost efficacy, razor sharp precision, and not to mention, consistency. With the flip of a switch, we provide all that and more. Simlart gives everyone the tools they need and the trust they expect to know that everything simply works as it is supposed to. We do this by linking everything back to detection, identification and verification of faces and objects through biometric facial recognition technology, which provides certainty that the information being received is indicative of the actions being performed in front of the camera. Our technology helps our customers manage and monitor the activities of the persons they are responsible for and ensures that every single one is safe and secure, while the organization stays informed and in control at all times. OVERVIEW Smilart s facial recognition technology (FRT) can be divided into three main applications: detection, identification and verification. DETECTION IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION. Our solution is currently the fastest on the market and the sensitivity of our technology is also adjustable to particular functions depending on what a client s ultimate purpose for having this system is, thus it is multifunctional at the flip of a proverbial switch. DETECTION Detection works by utilizing our patented algorithm which processes incoming camera images and then determines on a mathematical level if this received information is indicative of a human face or not, in just a few milliseconds. ARE YOU HUMAN? Detection can best be described as the biometric answer to either the question, ""Is that an image of a human face,"" or to, ""Is that an object?"" When an image is introduced to the system in detection mode, our software can instantaneously, within a few milliseconds and with 100% accuracy, determine if that image is in fact that of a human face or of some non-human object. What s more, Smilart FRT can be used in detection mode to identify if, for instance, a seat belt is being worn or what the characteristics of a license plate are, as well as determine if an online subscriber is uploading an image of a human face to their profile, and so on. The possibilities are vast. APPLICATIONS: STADIUM - Keep an accurate head count of the number of visitors to sporting events; crowd control, etc. VENUES - Tally customers to entertainment, hospitality, social and business events. ONLINE SERVICES - Many dating sites and other social networking and services sites must determine if subscribers are uploading actual photos. RETAILERS - Retailers often require accurate customer counts for data analytics and we provide that accuracy. LEFT ITEMS - Airports, public areas and other places that are either vulnerable to security threats or where people can accidentally forget belongings, can be scanned for left behind objects. MOTER VEHICLE SAFETY - Assists law enforcement to more precisely detect if passengers are wearing their seat belts. TRAFFIC SAFETY - Scan for license plates, broken wind shields, tinted windows, etc. IMMIGRATION - Everything from passport scanning to immigration security to duplicate application detection. SOCIAL NETWORKS - Face tagging. DETECT THE POSSIBILITIES From law enforcement to image scanning, from photo IDs to bank cards, Smilart detection solutions are your go-to source for high-tech, high value, low cost solutions. Our platform is adaptable to almost any convenience or task. If you think that biometric detection may help you but have questions, contact us now to learn how you can benefit. IDENTIFICATION Identification works by utilizing a subsequent patented in-house algorithm which processes an image or images as they come in and converts them to mathematical models we call faceprints. It then searches through a database of previously enrolled faceprints until it can find a match. This process takes 30 milliseconds ‚Äì the fastest in the world! WHO ARE YOU? To help clarify identification, it is the biometric answer to the question, ""Who is this person?"" When an image is introduced to the system in identification mode, whether that image is provided voluntarily, for example when entering or exiting a premises through a controlled passageway, or involuntarily, for instance when a camera is scanning a public place with numerous individuals, our software can instantaneously, within 30 milliseconds, determine if that image is in fact that of an individual who is enrolled into a preexisting database and then confirm if there is a match. What s more, our identification solutions can robustly identify people and have proven to be resistant to occlusions, aging, pose and even glasses. Smilart FRT identification technology can be used in an almost unlimited variety of ways and industries and is custom tailored to each customer s special requirements; therefore, the range of applications is enormous. FEATURES FAST High optimization Uses GPU for lightning speed processing 30 milliseconds per search ‚Äì fastest in the world! FLEXIBLE Client specific installation instead of one size fits all Scalable architecture Adjustable to specific task or purpose at the flip of a switch RELIABLE Impeccable and unrivaled accuracy 100% secure Very high redundancy ORIGINAL 100% in-house developed platform, coding, patents, and algorithm (true vendor) No additional license payments to outside vendors VALUE Competitively priced Superior product - best on the market. TECHNOLOGY OPEN SOURCE SYSTEMS CoreOS - operating system RabbitMQ (AMQP) - messaging, API Docker - container platform MongoDB - database OPTIMIZATION & CONCURRENCY nVidia CUDA - GPU microprogramming DEPENDING ON USER NEEDS Cheaper consumer-grade systems with game-optimized GPUs (e.g. nVidia GTX-1080) Clusters of enterprise-grade systems with individual GPUs (nVidia Tesla). APPLICATIONS: Airports - Homeland security, security checkpoints, catch wanted persons, access management, workforce management, data compilation, control congestion, customs enforcement. Schools - Keep intruders out, keep children safe, adult drop-off and pick-up security and no need for any ""secret passwords"", staff screening, off-campus control, enrollment ease. Subway & Rail Stations - Security checks, ticketing automation, workforce management, access control. Law enforcement -  Catch bad guys, authenticate IDs and identity, monitor streets and public places, arrest processing. Online services - Application processing & duplication deterrence, subscriptions & renewals, ID card renewals including government issued, bank cards, money transfer security, fraud prevention, gaming. Power, Energy & Utilities - Safety & security control, workforce management, checkpoints, access. Logistics - Cargo holds, consignment, workforce management, access, authorization, customs. Hospitality - Check-in services, keyless entry, access management & security, VIP guest recognition, ""bill it to the room"" confirmation, grounds, staff & guest monitoring. Property & Facilities Management - Entry & access, security, personnel management (in office buildings, in gated residential communities, in plants and factories). Casinos & Gaming - Cheaters beware, guest services and VIPs, security, guest movement, concierge and valet, employee ID. Public areas - Park safety, monitor outdoor venues, crowd control, ID wanted persons, neighborhood watch, safety, control vandalism. Entertainment venues - Ticketing, security surveillance, access.

IDENTIFY THE UNKNOWN From offices to police stations, from surveillance to access management, Smilart identification is your go-to source for high-tech, high value, low cost solutions. Our platform is adaptable to almost any convenience or task. If you think that biometric identification may help you but have some questions, contact us now to learn how you can benefit. VERIFICATION Finally, verification works when an incoming image asserts that it has a previously enrolled faceprint in the database and requests confirmation of this, where then the software pulls that alleged print from the database and then decides if it in fact does or does not match the new image. IS THAT REALLY YOU? Verification is just that. Our platform realizes if an individual is or is not who they say they are. To best visualize the process, verification is the biometric answer to, ""System: this is who I am. Can you please verify that?"" When an image is introduced to the system in verification mode, an individual enrolled in the organization s database may ask the system to confirm whether or not he or she is in fact that particular individual in order to, for instance, gain access to an entrance, a post office or bank safe deposit box, a secure area, an online exam website, or any number of other permissions. Very often verification is used as a secondary security feature in tandem with some other access mechanism such as a keycard, a fingerprint, a biometric scan, or any number of other access devices or mechanisms. Say an employee wants access to a facility or a gym member wants to enter a fitness center. That individual may swipe their card and as an authenticity safeguard will be asked to look into a camera. The swipe of the card notifies the system that person X wants access. The system than searches through its database for person X s preexisting faceprint and matches it to the fresh image. If they match then access is granted, if not, it is denied. Besides office buildings and other facilities that require basic security, verification is particularly valuable to organizations with high employee turnover rates, sensitive security issues, and those that incur losses from lost or stolen access items such as keycards, or from forbidden manipulation of those same types of access mechanisms. When the wrong person is in possession of an access device or has found a way to trick an outdated access system, it can at best become a costly situation and at worst, a serious threat. In scenarios where security is of major importance such as in a correctional facility, verification is a surefire way to permanently close the breach. Research has proven that even fingerprints are not 100% distinctive as previously thought. Smilart FRT verification can be used in a number of different ways depending on each customer s unique demands. The applications are limitless! APPLICATIONS: Online education - Make sure your distance learning students are the ones taking the exams. Military - Secure your base or facility from intrusion, grant or deny access based on authorization, modern equipment can be set to work for the rightful owner only. Detention, Penal & correctional - Control who goes in and out, inmate verification, inmate processing. Banking - Authorized card and account holders, access to vaults and other secure areas, access to safe deposit boxes. Post office - Access to rightful P.O. Box customers, employee access management. Online services - Accept/deny online applications or visa applications, stop credit card fraud, verify age, renew IDs or credit cards or subscriptions, monitor online gaming, etc. Law enforcement - Verify identity of suspects as well as gender and ethnicity, criminal database processing at the station or in the streets, arrest processing, serve warrants accurately, confirm registrations and ownership. Property & facility management - Employee access, member authorization, security passage, school safety and access (government buildings, plants, factories). TRUST BUT VERIFY Whether a tool for private investigators or as a measure for child safety in schools and amusement parks, from accessing restricted by-clearance areas or confirming membership, Smilart verification solutions are your go-to source for high-tech, high value, low cost solutions. Our platform is adaptable to almost any convenience or task. If you think that biometric verification may help you but have some questions, contact us now to learn how you can benefit.

HOW WE GOT HERE Smilart was founded in 2005 when two entrepreneurs with backgrounds in banking and computer gaming met two scientists specializing in visual object processing. Together they decided to form Smilart. The first result of their collaboration was an online photo editor, which was extremely effective in removing the infamous  red eye  effect from pictures, a necessary demand at that time. Other products soon followed, effectively establishing the company as a major player in the market for visual processing. Smilart then attracted the attention of a major investment firm whose focus was the high-tech industry. Having quickly secured the necessary financing Smilart began developing new projects.The Smilart platform is a technology stack which uses facial recognition algorithms to reliably identify humans in cooperative and uncooperative real-time scenarios. Our advanced algorithms are a culmination of years of research in the fields of computer vision, digital signal processing and machine learning. They can precisely identify people (as well as objects) and have proven to be resistant to occlusions, aging, pose and even glasses. Smilart is currently used in numerous production and development projects and by private organizations and government agencies alike.",https://www.smilart.com/,219,8/13/06,8/14/25

931,Tech5,Switzerland,2018,Private,1,0,1,1,0,0,https://tech5.ai/,https://tech5.ai/,,"A TECHNOLOGIES FOR INCLUSION COMPANY. TECH5 BIOMETRIC MODALITIES. FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION The use of Fingerprint to establish or confirm a person s identity is among the oldest biometric techniques used in the world. This type of recognition relies on taking an image of an individual s fingerprint and comparing it to a single image of that fingerprint or one stored in a database of images. The ability to implement this technology to unlock smart phones, log in to computers or gain access to physically secure environments has made it hugely popular. IRIS RECOGNITION Iris Recognition is generally considered one of the most accurate and reliable biometric modalities because it capitalizes on the uniqueness and stability of the colored portion of the eye, which can be seen even from a distance. First patented in 1987, iris recognition is now widely used in National Identification programs as well as for personal identity confirmation. FACE RECOGNITION Face Recognition is fast becoming the most popular biometric technology thanks to significant improvements in accuracy afforded by Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Neural Networks). It is now possible to obtain excellent matching accuracy even with variations due to aging, lighting conditions, expression, and even extreme pose. These features make face recognition highly suitable for forensic applications, ID solutions and mobile authentication. TECH5 FACE RECOGNITION: FAST AND ACCURATE IN VERY LARGE DATABASES The high-speed and extremely accurate TECH5 face recognition technology has proven its efficiency in real-world projects that work with national databases consisting of hundreds of millions of faces and capable of processing millions of operations in real-time. Our face recognition technology is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the most up to date architecture and progressive methods of training that permit the highest accuracy for both identification (1:N match) and verification (1:1 match). Our face recognition technology has been trained on diverse databases, and as such, the algorithm remains invariant across different nations, ages and genders, showing high accuracy not only for Asians, Europeans and Africans, but also for different nations within these continents. TECH5 FACE RECOGNITION DRIVES THE FOLLOWING USE CASES:  ID MANAGEMENT Real-time verification and identification against millions of records in an enrollment database ÓÉØ CITY SURVEILLANCE Online face recognition using regular CCTV camera feeds deployed in Safe Cities projects IMMIGRATION AND PASSPORT CONTROL Reliable identity verification for fast border crossing and entry prevention of unwanted visitors FACE FORENSICS Fast search of suspects identified in video records. Rapid identification of suspects and victims in field-forensic applications Óòç ACCESS CONTROL Secure, accurate and user-friendly access control and time attendance PRISON MANAGEMENT Fast ID checking of prisoners as well as visitors. ADVANTAGES & BENEFITS: RECOGNIZABLE, EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE IT YOURSELF Subjects in any position can be recognized, despite angles and turns, facial expressions, glasses, occlusions or even gender transformations. The image can be obtained from any source including, but not limited to, an ID photo, selfie, CCTV feed or social network image. CROSS-PLATFORM SOFTWARE AND COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF (COTS) HARDWARE: No risk of getting locked into expensive or specialized hardware and software. You can run TECH5 face recognition on high-speed GPU, standard CPU and mobile ARM platforms. Choose between Linux, Windows, Android or iOS. HIGH SPEED AND PERFORMANCE: Our high-speed processing saves you money on buying hardware. We process up to 150 images in real time using one GPU and search against a database of 100M images in 1 second with a single CPU. SECURITY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION: Protect your data from misuse or tampering. All biometric data is transferred as encrypted templates, which are irreversible and can be used on Android or iOS. AGE AND GENDER: Do you want to know your customers or audience? Add more analytics to your face recognition. Our advanced algorithms can classify faces by age, gender, race and nation. ANTI-SPOOFING: Protect your users from tampering. Advanced liveness detection algorithms seamlessly prevent unauthorized access by using printed or displayed images, video, and masks.

Automated Biometric Identification System: The efficacy of an identity management solution depends on the reliability and integrity of its database. It is thus crucial that there should be no duplicate records in the system. This is achieved by various biometric identifiers that correspond to a person uniquely. Quantifiable biometric characteristics include fingerprint, face, iris and palm print. Often multi-modal biometrics are used to enhance the integrity of a system. Automated Fingerprint Identification System The most common biometric used in automated identification is the fingerprint. Automated Fingerprint Identification System, TigerAFIS, is certified by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Its speed and accuracy of its proprietary fingerprint matching technique makes it suitable for very large scale (millions records) de-duplications. Tiger AFIS is currently used for a total of over 500million records with an average of 500,000 transactions performed daily all over the world. Ranked  1 in NIST MINEX 2009 Ranked among top 3 in NIST PFT Tests in US POE / POEBVA Datasets Ranked  1 for Lowest EER in FVC-OnGoing (as of Aug  11) Accuracy of 99.9% for two fingers Latent Fingerprint/Palm print Tiger AFIS technology allows law enforcement agencies to obtain and store latent print images from a variety of sources including scanners, high resolution digital cameras, and industry standard digital image formats. Its latent print image enhancement tool which simplifies verification and editing process including finger/palm print rotation, image reversal, contrast/brightness adjustments and comprehensive search and review. The image enhancement tool can load ten print card Detect the ROI of the fingerprints and user can manually correct the ROI if needed The minutiae are automatically detected Matched image can be showed side by side for manual examination Similarly palm print can be enhanced, search and examined. It supports partial palm print. Our implemented technology to create WSQ images for fingerprint meets FBI and NIST accuracy requirements as specified in WSQ Gray-Scale Fingerprint Image Compression Specification Version 3.1. It matches the criteria for 500ppi grayscale image, 8 bits per pixel (256) at 5:1 and 15:1 target compression ratios. This enables our clients to be sure they are getting a top-tier WSQ solution. Face Recognition System With detection accuracy nearly 100%, TigerIT  s proprietary face matching technique is used for both verification (1:1) and identification (1:N). Its adjustable learning based Matching System is aided by robust facial feature localization that extracts facial features in different illumination and environmental conditions and generates an optimal face template. Fast enrolling speed ‚Äì 10 enrollments per core-second Ultra-fast matching speed ‚Äì 3,000,000 matches per core-second Matching accuracy ~0.37% at FAR 0.001 for ICAO standardized images ~1.27% at FAR 0.001 for any recognized frontal face databases (Non ICAO standard) Support for recognized image formats including JPEG2000 format Field adjustable image resolution support Iris Integration We can integrate Iris capture and matching algorithms to support Robust iris detection Automatic interlacing detection and correction Correct iris segmentation Standard Compatibility - ISO 19794-6(2005, 2010) Adjudication Adjudication is the process to determine if a hit in the AFIS is in fact a real or a false match. It assists operators by showing all biometrics on screen (side-by-side as shown below), zoomed to help in the comparison process and also all scores in a multi-modal matching system. The adjudication workflow options include the ability to randomly assign a hit result to an adjudicator (given multiple adjudicators exist in the enterprise), and to have more than one adjudicator review each hit result (again this can be randomly assigned to the second adjudicator to prevent any collusion). In addition, an ""Investigate"" state can be instantiated to enable a committee or assigned investigator to review the file in much more detail and scrutiny, including possibly calling the person back in for an interview. TgerIT Adjudicate enables identity adjudicators to review the match results from TigerAFIS as well as potentially disqualifying information from 3rd party authoritative sources (e.g. police record). Personalization Solutions: TigerIT offers a number of solutions that run at the Data Center or Personalization Center to consolidate and streamline the front office services. Credential Management System. Inventory Management Module. Tiger IDM. Key Management System. Civil Registry Solutions: Focused on scalability and extensibility, our registration and enrollment solutions are ideal for large and very large scale applications that include, among many others: Census Registration and National ID Continuous Voter Registration and Electoral Roll Electronic Travel Documents Employee Registration with Time and Attendance Bank Client Identification Immigration Control and Border Management Criminal Records Automation and Look-up Driver s License Healthcare & Welfare Benefits Management TigerID Enroll TigerID Enroll captures biographical information (demographics) as alphanumeric text keyed-in from paper forms, pre-registered over the Internet or from digitization of scanned forms. The application can be used on desktop PCs as well as handheld devices for registration in remote areas. Capture fingerprint, photo, signature, iris Fingerprint capture supports ISO/IEC 19794-4, INCITS 381-2004, NISTIR 7151, INCITS 378-2004, and ISO/IEC 19794-2, among others Photo capture supports ISO/IEC FCD 19794-5, ISO/IEC 19794-5, INCITS 385-2004, ICAO Doc 9303, JPEG2000 Live quality assurance and feedback for biometric data Built-in Peripheral hardware diagnostics Handle cases for missing fingerprints Validation checks for multiple enrollment of same fingerprint and against operator prints Support distributed enrollment and storage, for registrations across regions Offline and online modes to overcome infrastructure limitations TigerID Enroll has been used to register more than 200 million identities from various vendors worldwide. Online Pre-registration This module allows an applicant to fill the relevant application form online. The online form is often displayed in local languages for easy comprehension. Usually application forms are for New registrations Renewal Replacement of damaged or lost passports. Once complete with validation checks passed, the applicant is able to print the form for later submission. The form will contain a unique ID number in digits as well as barcode. This number will be used by the data entry officials to identify the applicant from the database. This saves enrollment operators time to enter data and also minimizes errors by the data entry operator. Digitization Module Often government and other running agencies have filled paper application forms for existing users that need to be imported into the electronic system to avoid data duplication and reduce data collection overhead. The Digitization Module provides tools for extracting text data using Optical Character Recognition,as well as fingerprint and photo from scanning the pre-filled paper forms. The data entry component for the scanned documents supports cascade view of scanned form and extracted data, as well as vetting of multiple entries of same form (by multiple data entry operator, at times done to reduce data entry errors). Fingerprint extraction comes with image segmentation to reduce noise, WSQ compression meeting WSQ Gray-Scale Fingerprint Image Compression Specification Version 3.1 and image quality score for each fingerprint recorded, based on ISO 29794-4 standard. The photo extraction tool ensures ICAO Full Frontal Image requirements (ISO/IEC FCD 19794-5) based on eyes and mouth detection and incorporates intelligent photo cropping to meet target quality benchmark. Proofing after Enrollment A key step after enrollment is to verify the authenticity and uniqueness of the entry. The proofing tool helps the vetting of the applicant by searching for relevant data in external sources. Finally, qualified specialists in the registration team review and adjudicate all of the proofing and vetting results. The process can be done in batch or individually, depending on the type of credential and the local laws and policies and authoritative sources. For example, ICAO and leading passport agency best-practices and policies encourage that a passport applicant s claimed citizenship status and identity be verified by a minimum of one, and preferably two or more, authoritative sources such as other government agencies that register and issue reference credentials such as birth certificates, driver licenses national ID cards, voter registration ID cards, etc. Furthermore, any available criminal history and behavior checks can be leveraged to determine if the applicant may have been involved in criminal, terrorist, or counterfeiting activities in the past that may prevent them from receiving an admission. For example, a variety of text-based databases are hosted and maintained by Interpol that are available to deliver criminal, terrorist and counterfeiter query results to an adjudication officer to help establish a risk level for each applicant.

Onboarding Remote approvals Know Your Customer (KYC). Digital Signature: What is Digital Signature? Digital Signature is an innovative new cloud-based service from TOC Biometrics which allows organisations ‚Äì both commercial and governmental ‚Äì to incorporate simple electronic signatures into their PDF documents. As a key part of the TOC ID Verification system ‚Äì utilising advanced facial and fingerprint biometrics and public key infrastructure (PKI) technology ‚Äì the Digital Signature tool brings together the documentation to be signed and the personal authentication information required to ensure approval and acceptance of the relevant commercial and legal terms. Here s how it works Digital Signature from TOC Biometrics provides highly validated Remote Approvals and can be integrated into existing systems quickly and easily. Through a secure communication to our cloud API ‚Äì using the latest Representational State Transfer (REST) technology ‚Äì documents are digitally signed and a  cryptographic stamp  certificate is issued. This smart identity validation and document approval solution can help to streamline complex workflows and business-critical customer journeys. The TOC Biometrics SIGNER validates ‚Äì triangulates ‚Äì that the verification has been correctly carried out and that the established business rules have been met. If the biometric transaction was valid, the signer stamps the document digitally with a certificate and the data of the person ‚Äì as well as the photo of the face used ‚Äì are captured on the document. The digital certificate that is  stamped  on the document contains the property of TIMESTAMP, which allows administrators to know with certainty the exact moment ‚Äì both time and date ‚Äì of the signature. This property is immutable. In addition, TOC Biometrics generates a log for each signature made, identifying the integrator, the signer and also the TIMESTAMP associated with the digital certificate, which allows a traceability of the signature. We make this data available to the integrator. OUR TECHNOLOGY: THE WORLD S MOST ADVANCED ID VERIFICATION SOLUTIONS FROM TOC BIOMETRICS. CLOUD-BASED BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION: Leading the fight against Identity Theft Whatever industry sector or government department you re in, Identity Theft is a big problem ‚Äì and it s getting bigger every day. It is already the world s most common type of fraud but with the ongoing digital revolution and the steady rise in online transactions, the daily occurrence of Identity Theft is increasing exponentially. The simple answer for banking, insurance, retail, healthcare and government organisations is to authenticate their current and future clients remotely ‚Äì both online and mobile. Unfortunately, traditional authentication solutions will only link a given device with the corresponding customer account ‚Äì rather than authenticating the actual user themselves. Fortunately, at TOC Biometrics we have solved this problem by developing the world s most advanced ID Verification solution. Device authentication is not Identity Verification Even modern devices that use biometric data ‚Äì like fingerprint scanning and facial recognition ‚Äì still only link users to the device where the data is stored. The true power of biometric authentication will only be unleashed when organisations move the process away from the device and onto the cloud. Our unique cloud-based biometric ID Verification service creates a unique digital template for genuine customers which is then stored securely in the form of a mathematical construct, so that any organisations or institutions can accurately verify that it is the correct person ‚Äì not just the correct device ‚Äì performing a transaction. The ID Verification service from TOC Biometrics comprises a number of advanced technology components and there are many more exciting developments in the pipeline. BIOMETRIC FACIAL RECOGNITION: The advanced Biometric Facial Recognition solution from TOC Biometrics is based on cutting-edge neural network and deep learning technology. With an accuracy rate already greater than 99%, the specialised Biometric Facial Recognition engine is trained to compare photos taken by users with photos on their official ID documents and identify a positive match. The system is continuously learning so performance and accuracy will improve further over time. Reduce operational risk Ensure regulatory compliance Lower processing costs Improve customer service. ID DOCUMENT CHECKING Discover what the new ID Verification Service from TOC Biometrics can do for your business, explore our functionality with our live demo apps and register for an account to road-test our API. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Facial Recognition technology generally involves determining the identity of an individual person by capturing a number of intrinsic facial characteristics and comparing them with the images of a group of people already classified. The traditional matching process relies on computer algorithms which are notoriously inaccurate ‚Äì they are often deliberately configured to generate false positive results that a human then needs to check, verify and eliminate. To improve the effectiveness of this artificial vision and matching task, TOC Biometrics has developed an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine that focuses on comparing just two sets of facial data ‚Äì usually a self-taken photograph and the image on an official identity card. We have created a convolutional neural network (CNN) in which neurons correspond to receptive fields ‚Äì this is very similar to the way neurons in the primary visual cortex of a biological human brain work. Reduce operational risk Ensure regulatory compliance Lower processing costs Improve customer service. LIVENESS DETECTION: For Facial Recognition technology to work effectively as an ID Verification system, it has to be able to differentiate between a real, live human being and a two-dimensional photo or video of that person. The Liveness Detection feature from TOC Biometrics analyses still and moving images and uses complex algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to establish that a person is, indeed, alive. Reduce operational risk Ensure regulatory compliance Lower processing costs Improve customer service. YOUR INDUSTRY: Whether you are a bank, insurer, retailer, healthcare provider or government agency, the advanced ID Verification Service from TOC Biometrics can help you transform your digital customer authentication processes.

TouchByte is a software company that improves people s lives by taking out points of ""Friction"" from their daily routines. We do this by creating, implementing and supporting Face Recognition software solutions for national and global clients to better serve and safeguard their customers. ""We add to a stress free life taking away the thought that; have I got my house keys, my car keys, my office pass, my season ticket, my credit card, my loyalty card, my gym access card, my hotel bedroom key or my wallet. You also don t have to worry whether you have internet access or is my battery charged!""  Everything is triggered by your FACE! FaceStream Lite: We provide anonymous but accurate footfall, demographic (age & gender) and mood information which helps organisations improve their knowledge and understanding of their visiting customers  behaviour. The resulting insights into customer segmentation and predictive analytics (InSite2) can then be used to manage resources more effectively and so maximise revenue and profitability. Also relevant content can be triggered and presented on Digital Signage. No personal data is stored. FaceStream Plus: FaceStream Plus provides footfall and demographic data and adds people recognition from a stored digital image that the system is able to recognise, allow access and notify staff upon them entering the building - VIPs, valued and repeat customers. They can then benefit from the customer s bespoke and premium level of service. Those that arrive and need assistance can be helped immediately by an appropriate customer service agent or the notification of registered troublemakers making it a safer environment. In this case individuals need to have agreed to their data being held as part of the GDPR rules. Facentry - Access Control: Using an individual s FACE as a means of authentication is one of the most secure, unobtrusive and easy ways to ensure a person s validity and allow them access to information, a room or a building. Your FACE is being used to unlock you phone so why not your car, you house, your office your Hotel bedroom and even gaining access to the gym 24/7. Facentry has been developed to be secure (anti face spoofing is built-in) and if a person wishes to not use their FACE a QR code can be used instead. The QR code option can also provide 2 factor authentication - FACE and QR code have to be entered before access allowed. AgeCheck: Age Verification is the core component to TouchByte s software product AgeCheck. A customer purchases an age restricted product and the system using the FACE algorithm estimates their age. For safety the system has a set limit of age 30 so if anyone who the system thinks is over 30 the transaction will continue with no intervention. If the system thinks the person is under 30 the transaction is held and the procedure reverts to the normal personal validation. We monitor the whole transaction from start to finish so if we see anyone young during the transaction it reverts back to normal. Individuals can choose to enrol on the system so there is no need to carry ID. The software can be used for Supermarket self-service checkouts, lottery terminals, slot machines, online gambling and other age related applications. Investment - TouchByte is currently seeking funding to accelorate it s growth potential. Solutions for most sectors! Retail, Transport, Leisure, Hotels, Education, Health, Marine, Home Care. ""We take the use of personal data very seriously"". Ensuring our customers comply with GDPR rules around customer privacy. FaceStream - Video Analytics using Face Recognition (Off line Google Analytics). People Recognition: By monitoring an entrance or a designated area, we can identify people that are enrolled in various categories that have different triggers associated with them. Opted in Images may be stored for premium customer service reasons, so the arrival of a VIP / valued customer would immediately trigger a notification to customer service. For safety reasons known registered troublemakers would be highlighted and immediately notified to security. This allows you to offer a differentiated level of customer service and operate a safer environment for your visiting customers. All enrolled images are governed by GDPR rules.

Our patented technology creates tokenized identities from any biometric modality (or other identity data), from any source. The most comprehensive AI-powered facial biometric identity authentication solution. We provide Identity and Trust as a Service to answer two fundamental questions: ""Who are you?"" and ""Do I trust you?"" Our patented technology creates tokenized identities (using a proprietary EgHash‚Ñ¢ architecture) from any modality or source allowing comparison of like-modality templates from different sources, and breaking vendor lock-in. Our immutable EgHash‚Ñ¢ is created using a one-way transformation, isnot-PII and is ""anonymized data"" under legislation such as GDPR. Using our hashing to create digital identities protects against databreaches and allows controlled data sharing as only our AI can create a probabilistic zero knowledge proof as to whether two EgHash‚Ñ¢ originated from the same person. Our EgHash‚Ñ¢ can also act as a pivot to unlimited externally stored data and using pivot tables, the linked data and access permissions can be changed to reflect changes in data needs and render data access ""self-sovereign"". Combined with proof of life and other presentation attack detection AI s, our hashing process identifies duplicate and synthetic identities that pass siloed KYC/AML/onboarding processes.  The EgHash‚Ñ¢ can be stored on-premises and/or in the cloud and/or in a blockchain or other distributed ledger, or even on the originating device. To counter fraud, the EgHash‚Ñ¢ can be stored or copied to a shared Identity Lake‚Ñ¢ and/or used to service zero-knowledge-proofs.  Whether you need to onboard new users, provide access to existing accounts, authenticate for higher risk transactions, identify persons-of-interest, or create identities for undocumentedor thin-file subjects, our hashing technology will work with your existing and future authentication modalities to provide an unparalleled level of efficiency and security for your identity programs. TrustStamp.ai for Banking and Fintech: We empower financial institutions to onboard customers faster, keep accounts secure, and prevent fraudsters from accessing services. Financial Institutions rely on secure, accurate, and efficient identity authentication solutions to protect themselves and their customers. Trust Stamp works with organizations on the cutting edge of financial security to do just that. TrustStamp.ai for Real Estate: We empower agents to trust and identify clients before meeting them in potentially risky situations. Using Trust Stamp for your business: We use sophisticated algorithms and artificial intelligence to prove your customer s identity then our service reads the data from your customer s documents to create the customer report. Agents must confirm the data provided by their customers and that they have met them. Our service assists Estate Agents in meeting the requirements of the Regulations but is not a substitute for the Risk Based Assessment demanded by law. TrustStamp.ai for Biometrically-Secured Email: The first end-to-end encrypted email protected with the most secure biometric marker: your face. TrustStamp.ai for KYC/AML Compliance We make complying with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements easy. Your Solution to Email Fraud  When we share confidential information with a confidante we ideally do so ""face to face"" but how can that work using the speed and convenience of an e-mail? With Trusted Mail the recipient is confident that the communication was generated by a specific sender and has not been tampered with en-route. To protect e-mail in transit, Trusted Mail layers proprietary encryption techniques utilizing hashed facial biometrics. TrustStamp.ai for KYC/AML Compliance: We make complying with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements easy. Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering. To address the exponential growth in KYC/AML requirements, we empower businesses with a completely automated transaction including our facial biometric tools and proprietary document OCR. Our multi-layer, automated, risk-based process speeds the process for both institutions and customers and provides audit trails, compliance reports and fuzzy logic to identify risky transactions and potential non-compliance. Humanitarian: Identifying victims of human trafficking with international Attorneys General. In collaboration with CWAG (Conference of Western Attorneys General) and the Alliance Partnership, Trust Stamp has built a consortium Identity Lake shared between the Attorneys General of New Mexico and Guanajuato, Mexico. Using Trust Stamp s Facial Matching and Hashing Technology, the two Attorneys General offices can share hashes related to human trafficking persons of interest. The Identity Lake is a proven method of cross jurisdictional, compliant data sharing. Technology that creates unique, irreversible hashed-tokenized identities and facilitates secure, interoperable identity proofing ‚Äì anywhere in the world, online and offline.  WHAT: Irreversible, hashed-tokenized identities. WHY: The effectiveness of all identity data is maximized when it is rendered safe to use, store, and share. HOW: Deep neural networks convert any identifying data into a unique, non-PII EgHash. Security. Interoperability. WHAT: Secure, interoperable identity proofing. WHY: Zero-knowledge authentication provides security beyond that of siloed, legacy authentication systems that are prone to sensitive data leakage and fraud. HOW: Probabilistic AI predicts whether multiple EgHashes came from the same face, without the need to store or share sensitive information. Our mission is to create transformational technology that accelerates secure societal and financial inclusion. Current Issues. Synthetic Identity Fraud: Fraudsters have access to fraudulent identification documents which allow them to pass siloed biometric systems. Annually, over $40 Billion lost to synthetic and stolen identity fraud and over $20 Billion lost to legitimate transactions failing legacy authentication. Security: Legacy identity authentication takes place in a ""silo"" with matched data required for authentication. Data points used are virtually always PII and data leakage at one institution can invalidate authentication at multiple institutions. Financial Inclusion: Over 2 Billion people globally are undocumented & financially excluded, and 4 Billion people are financially under-served. This represents a potential $3.7 Trillion annual growth in global GDPR. Our Vision: A world where secure, trusted identity is a universal human right, empowering opportunity and access -- and technical interoperability facilitates an open ecosystem, enabling barrier-free global value exchange. Secure & Trusted Identity for all People: Every human being, regardless of location or connectivity, has an established existence and a means of proving their identity without the need to share personal records. Opportunity & Access: Access to services is no longer limited by a person s ability to prove identity, making the opportunity for economic mobility and elevated quality of life universal.

Remotely Authenticate Quickly, Securely and Cost-efficiently Without compromising on regulation compliance. EMPLOYEE AUTHENTICATION Remote Authentication. Be more secure and cost-efficient. Reduce IT help desk calls. Biometric Employee Authentication. Like many organizations, you probably find yourself performing a constant balancing act: on one hand, you need your employees to create complex, unique and uncrackable passwords, and you need them updating regularly‚Ä¶ on the other, they need something they can actually remember! It s an impossible decision ‚Äì do you sacrifice security for usability, or usability for security? Whichever way you go, there are enormous costs involved; whether it s reputational damage from passwords lost through a security breach, or just the time and resources it takes to reset forgotten passwords, removing passwords from the employee authentication process is a win-win for everyone involved. A User Experience Like No Other A simple multi-factor biometric authentication process makes accessing apps easier for your employees and more difficult for malicious actors. Offering facial, fingerprint and passive behavioral options, alongside native or third-party biometrics, Veridium lets your employees authenticate without tying them up in endless layers of security ‚Äì and what s more, it keeps track of everything that s happening, ensuring non-repudiation, traceability and regulatory compliance. Enable Employees to Work From Home - Securely Using biometric mobile first MFA your employees can remotely authenticate, without a compromise on security and all the while ensuring non-repudiation. Regulatory requirements are also met, for example behavioural biometrics ensure geo-location access is managed, and our distributed storage ensures GDPR compliance. Cut Costs and Increase Productivity. Employee Authentication with Veridium: COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM? IAM PARTNERSHIPS LEGALLY BINDING AUDIT TRAILS REGULATORY COMPLIANCE CLOUD AGNOSTIC. Remove Password Vulnerabilities. Improve Cybersecurity. CUSTOMER AUTHENTICATION Create a customer-winning user experience. Authenticate your customers. Simple and Secure We ve all been there. You want to move some money around, but can t remember your banking app s password. Or you re trying to buy something online, and have to toggle between apps to enter a one-time SMS code. It s infuriating, and you wouldn t be alone if you ve ended up abandoning your efforts. The VeridiumID biometric authentication platform lets you offer customers a simpler authentication experience. Using technologies they re already comfortable with, and the native hardware on their own devices, you can provide an authentication process that is not only easier than that of your competitors, but significantly more secure, all whilst complying with security regulations. Reduce Fraud. Increase Customer Satisfaction. TRANSACTION AUTHENTICATION Have non-repudiation. Always be compliant. Why Go Passwordless? Increased security, lower operational costs and a frictionless user experience, for even remote working, are some of the reasons why authentication is going passwordless. There s a reason passwords, pins, codes and tokens all persist, despite their user experience drawbacks ‚Äì security always has to be a top priority. While consumers and employees expect technology to deliver ever-simpler means of going about their business, they also recognize the dangers of online life. As sensitive data becomes ever more ubiquitous, and threats more sophisticated, governmental legislation and customer expectations require a constant balancing act between user experience and transaction protection. Mobile Multi-Factor Authentication Whether it s a customer confirming an online purchase, a lawyer needing an important legal document signed with non-repudiation baked in or a financial-trader making multi-million dollar transactions, non-repudiation authentication is a complicated business. The demands for multiple layers of authentication involve inconvenient and time-consuming hoops through which users must jump, and offer endless opportunities for both malicious attacks and human nature to subvert the process. Passwordless Authentication VeridiumID offers multi-factor biometric authentication through a user s own smartphone. No lost, stolen or loaned passwords. Taking advantage of a phone s native sensors you can now deploy multiple points of authentication through a single, familiar process. And because some transactions require more scrutiny than others, our step-up options are also completely passwordless, meaning you can be certain that someone is exactly who they say they are. Facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, behavioral analytics. Better Experience = Better Security. Cost Control. Managing user authentication can have a significant impact on a company s bottom line. Resetting passwords and replacing lost tokens cost organizations money. By simplifying the authentication process, you ll not only find yourself with more productive employees and happier customers, but you ll actually end up saving money. Why choose Veridium? NO PASSWORD REPLAY VeridiumID doesn t replay passwords on devices or in servers. There are no passwords. Ever.

It began with a blue string Growing up on a farm, hay bales were a staple of Kaarel Kotkas s childhood. At the age of 14, he noticed that the strings that bound them did not biodegrade, and often ended up littered across the fields of the otherwise pristine landscape of rural Estonia. Kaarel set out to find an environmentally-friendly alternative, and after browsing the web he came across the perfect string (it also came in his favorite color). As he registered an account on arguably the biggest global online marketplace, he was asked to verify that he was over 18. After a little photo editing, he breezed through their security and was able to buy the string. While his mission was a success, Kaarel couldn t stop thinking about how easy it was to pretend to be someone else online. If successful companies are this vulnerable to fraud, then smaller businesses don t stand a chance. This early experience planted the seed that would one day grow into Veriff. Kaarel founded Veriff in 2015 at the age of 20. Shortly after, it popped up on the global radar and in 2018 it joined the Y Combinator spring batch. Fast forward to now, Veriff has over 300 employees and serves over 190 countries as the gold standard for online identity verification.",https://www.veriff.com/,670,12/18/14,10/10/25

State-of-the-art face recognition: detection, tracking, identification as well as age and gender estimation - actively developed by Videmo for over 10 years. Face recognition directly from the manufacturer At Videmo, you get the recognition technology and the corresponding application from a single source. This way you can be sure to always get the best possible performance. Proven in practice It is important for us that our algorithms achieve good results not only in synthetic benchmarks but also in practical applications. Focus on video processing Our methods are inherently optimized for video processing, both live and retrospective. Up to date Having close contacts with research institutions, we are able to quickly incorporate the latest algorithms into our software. Deep Learning Deep Neural Networks (DNN) represent the state of the art in image analysis and are the technological foundation of our recognition methods. We train and evaluate neural networks with large amounts of data in order to achieve the optimal combination of recognition performance and speed. With hardware support (e.g. graphics cards), the high performance of the networks can also be used in real-time applications. Everything at a glance. Face detection We reliably find the position and location of faces in photos or videos. This usually works despite of unfavorable lighting, rotations, partial occlusion or poor video quality. In video, faces are tracked from frame to frame to form continuous tracks. These tracks can be used for more precise identification than single frames alone. Face recognition For facial recognition, so-called templates are extracted, which represent the individual characteristics of each face in a compact way. These templates can then be compared with reference templates of query identities. Creating identities from more than one reference template (""enrollment"") leads to better recognition rates than with single template comparison. Age and gender In addition to classic identification, the age and gender of individuals can also be estimated by analyzing the face. Thus, you can create statistics on the age and gender distribution of customer groups or start searches for these features (""soft biometrics""). Videmo 360 Face recognition redefined. Videmo 360 is the latest generation of face recognition software, combining retrospective analysis and live observation capabilities in a distributed, client-server-ready solution.

1040,VideoAnalysisTechnologies,Russian Federation,2010,Private,0,0,1,0,0,0,https://tevian.ru/,https://tevian.ai/,no strong candidates; using root landing,"Video Analysis Technologies is a young innovative company, established in 2010 by graduates of the Computer Graphics and Multimedia Lab, Department of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, Lomonosov Moscow State University which is one of the leading research groups in computer vision in Russia We specialize in applied R&D in the field of computer vision with primary focus on video analysis. Range of possible applications of our technologies includes security surveillance systems, audience analysis for Digital signage, intelligent search in video archives, augmented reality systems, etc. In 2010 our project ""Video-based demographic and behavioral audience analysis system"" was supported under the START program of State Fund for Support of Small Enterprises in the Scientific-Technical Fields. In 2011 the project was extended for the second year. In 2013 our company received a status of Skolkovo resident with a project ""Automatic annotation of video surveillance data for business intelligence and security systems"" At this point our key technologies are: gender and age classification face recognition face features detection. Face Classification From face image it is possible to determine a number of human attributes, such as gender, age, ethnicity, facial hair type and color, presence of spectacles, etc. It is also possible to determine face expressions, for example a smile. The problem of visual appearance features estimation from face images is generally known as  face classification . Face classification is useful in a number of different application, e.g: Demographic profiling of customers (e.g. for shop, cafe or retail bank office) Measurement of efficiency and audience analysis of Digital Signage systems Search of people in surveillance video archive Intelligent human-computer interface A pipeline of face classification algorithms is very similar to that of face recognition algorithms Extraction of person s faces from an image (Face Detection) Localization of facial keypoints (Face Features Detection). Often this stage is limited to specification of human s eyes only. Face image normalization, including image resize to the predefined resolution, head inclination elimination, face color correction (Face Normalization) Face descriptor computation. Contrary to the general knowledge, relative distances between facial keypoints are rarely used for face analysis and person identification. Usually a specific set of texture-based features are computed. (Feature extraction and descriptor computation) Person attributes estimation from descriptor. Pattern recognition algorithms, based on machine learning, are usually used for it. (Classification) The main performance characteristics of face classification algorithms are classification speed and precision. Similarly to face recognition algorithms precision of face classification substantially depends on the input data quality: image resolution and sharpness, viewing angle, lighting conditions, person mimic. Depending on the image the precision of the same classification algorithm can decrease from 95% to 50-70%. We have developed our own face classification algorithm. On our internal test dataset of 100K+ real-life photos gender classification accuracy is 90.1%, and mean age estimation error is 7.8 years. To evaluate its performance on your application we offer to test our software on your image dataset. If you have a large dataset for your specific scenario, our face classification algorithm can be tuned (trained) on your data, which will guarantee its maximal precision on this scenario. Face recognition Face recognition is one of the most demanded computer vision technologies for security systems and web-search. A list of potential applications includes: Identification of the person from photo (e.g. face matching with a photo database of known criminals) Access control for high-security places Identity confirmation (verification) by biometric passport Person search in surveillance video archive Automatic annotation of photos and videos in social networks Two application scenarios for face recognition should be distinguished: ""Face identification"". A face image of unknown person (named as ""test image"") and a gallery of known person s photos are supplied to the identification algorithm. The goal is to determine whether a person on the test image is present in the gallery, and if present to determine which one. ""Face verification"" or ""person identity confirmation"". Only two images are used as input data. Algorithm should determine whether both images capture the same person or two different persons. In general each scenario can be reduced to the other one. But each scenario sets different requirements on face recognition algorithm, which results in different training and tuning procedures. Most face recognition algorithms share the same operation procedure: Extraction of person s faces from an image (Face Detection) Localization of facial keypoints (Face Features Detection). Often this stage is limited to specification of human s eyes only. Face image normalization, including image resize to the predefined resolution, head inclination elimination, face color correction (Face Normalization) Face descriptor computation. Contrary to the general knowledge, relative distances between facial keypoints are rarely used for face analysis and person identification. Usually a specific set of texture-based features are computed. (Feature extraction and descriptor computation) Comparisons of descriptors of different faces (Verification, Template Matching) Usually several steps after face detection and before verification are collectively named ""Enrollment"", meaning that a new face image is processed and stored in the database. As face recognition algorithm is a pipeline, constructed from several consecutively applied algorithms, performance depends on accuracy of each stage. Technical details of each step are usually a commercial secret and described in a very general way. The main performance characteristics of face identification algorithms are descriptor computation speed (Enrollment), descriptors comparison time, precision of person identification Performance of face identification depends on many factors: image resolution (more correct face size on an image), image sharpness, viewing angle (frontal or at an angle), lighting, mimic, and size of the gallery. That is why an ""abstract"" recognition precision, mentioned in different news releases, without binding to a concrete face image dataset, used for measurements, does mean absolutely nothing. Under some ideal conditions a recognition precision can be even higher than human performance and reach the precision, demonstrated by eye iris recognition. But in practice the image recognition precision is significantly lower, which limits the range of possible applications. We have developed our own face recognition algorithm. To evaluate its performance on your application we offer to test our software on your image dataset. Face features detection Precise localization of facial keyponts, such as eye s centers, lips corners, nose tip, etc., is a necessary step for most face image analysis algorithms e.g. face recognition or classification. Also precise keypoint localization is necessary for image editing or manipulation. For example, augmented reality applications require keypoint localization to integrate virtual objects (hat or spectacles) in video stream. In many cases for face normalization it is enough to supply only a few selected keypoints, e.g. corners or centers of eyes. However, to improve robustness and precision a more extended set of keypoints is required, which permits to take into account their reciprocal position. Our face features detection algorithm permits localization of main anthropometric points in on-line video stream. FaceSDK is a software development kit that provides the face analysis engine to system integrators and other customers. Features include: face detection face tracking gender and age classification face recognition face features detection. Tevian Face Detection is an embedded application for Axis ip cameras. It allows storing face images in a local or remote archive. Also it can be used in conjunction with face recognition, running on a remote server. Quelytics is a cloud application to estimate queue size using video surveillance cameras. Licensing of our computer vision algorithms We have a range of licensing options for our technologies, including: unlimited non-exclusive license limited license, price based on number of computers limited license, price based on number of algorithm s runs Custom development and algorithm adaptation Many end-user applications set a specific set of requirements, which cannot be fulfilled by out-of-the box algorithms and SDKs. We can adapt our technologies to any custom application. In simple cases such adaptation requires only training and fine tuning of our algorithms on new custom dataset. In complex cases we can develop new algorithms starting from scratch. Consulting From our experience it is quite difficult for many potential customers to see both the capabilities and limitations of modern computer vision technologies. Judging from Hollywood movies and TV-shows, forensic experts can reliably identify a person of interest by magnifying a one pixel reflection in a mirror (which is, regretfully, not theoretically possible). But a lot of existing applications are not as widely popularized in modern arts. We can help with: establishing what problems can or cannot be solved with the help of modern computer vision algorithms choosing from available ready solutions search for a scientific papers on your subject Development of complete software solutions We offer a development of integrated system for solution of a specific computer vision problem.",,,,

BIOMETRIC VERIFICATION: STRENGTHENS YOUR ONBOARDING PROCESS greenID‚Ñ¢ Mobile incorporates biometric verification to reduce fraud Using greenID‚Ñ¢ Mobile you can capture customer details visually or audibly, for use as one-time verification or to be stored for future authentication purposes. Facial Biometrics Tests Ranked  1 Facial biometrics compare an image of an individual (such as a driver s licence photo) with a real-time image of that person (a selfie) to verify authenticity. The facial recognition system then uses algorithms and pattern matching to correctly identify face prints when images differ due to posing angle, illumination, facial hair, glasses and ageing. Most importantly, it reduces fraud and acts as a simple deterrent during the identity verification process, further reducing costs involved with manual checks. Voice Biometrics for Extra Security Voice biometrics compares a person s voiceprint to determine their identity. Once recorded, a customer voice can be checked against a range of factors including pitch, spectral magnitudes and frequencies. This combination of sound, pattern and rhythm is different to a natural conversation and provides a trusted verification tool that s difficult to fool. Capturing voiceprints is very simple, accurate and discreet facilitating a positive customer experience. Liveness Detection To protect yourself and your company against fraud, greenID‚Ñ¢ incorporates detection measures to ensure that a real person, not a computer BOT, is involved in transactions. For example, individuals must blink when taking a selfie to prove they are live and not merely a static photo. To combat pre-recorded voices, the system prompts individuals to repeat randomly generated phrases or a sequence of numbers to prove that they are human and not a recording.

Voatz is on a mission to make voting safer and more accessible. All citizens have a right to vote regardless of their circumstance. Available only by invitation from your election organizer in selected jurisdictions only. Are you an election administrator interested in trying out Voatz at your next federal, state or local election? Who is Voatz? Voatz is a mobile elections platform that makes it possible to vote from a mobile device by leveraging the security built into the latest versions of smartphone technology, and the immutability of the blockchain. Since June 2016, more than 80,000 votes have been cast on the Voatz platform across more than 50 elections. Voatz has experience working with both major political parties, churches, unions, universities, towns, cities, counties and state governments, all in the effort to make it safe, convenient and easy to vote. Why is Voatz in the elections industry? Voatz was started in 2015 by two co-founders after winning a hackathon at SXSW with an idea that would become the early seedlings of the Voatz platform. With careers in technology,digital security and mobile payments, they started an experiment to combine the latest advancements in smartphone technology with biometrics and blockchain technology in order to make voting more accessible and potentially evade voter coercion in certain circumstances. Voatz has since grown into a group of passionate people, all working to make voting as safe, accessible, easy and secure as possible. Yes. To date, Voatz has conducted more than 30 successful live elections that range from state party conventions, student government elections and town meeting voting. A number of these elections were scoped as pilots that have led to longer-term relationships with clients. In the largest election, more than 15,000 votes were cast. The purpose of all the Voatz pilots is to first and foremost deliver on stakeholder expectations, while also continuing to learn and improve the Voatz platform. On the Voatz app, authentication is a three-step process that uses the smartphone s camera and its biometric feature (i.e. fingerprint recognition or facial recognition): (1) the voter scans their state driver s license or passport, (2) takes a live facial snapshot (a video ""selfie""), and (3) touches the fingerprint reader on the smartphone, which ties the voter s device to the voter. Once the voter is authenticated, the app matches the voter s ""selfie"" to the facial picture on their passport or driver s license and confirms the voter s eligibility to vote against the state s voter registration database. Our Approach To Security. Security has been our utmost priority since day one, and it begins with how we build our technology. Across our corporate and elections infrastructure we follow industry best practices, including end-to-end encryption and layered security to provide defense in depth. In addition, we invest in frequent, ongoing audits by independent third parties external to Voatz. These audits involve a comprehensive examination of our voting platform, including the mobile application source code, backend infrastructure, and blockchain, as well as an assessment of the networks, computing devices, and processes used to transmit, process, and store voting data. We have voluntarily engaged with multiple agencies in DHS, including their Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with one of the leading federal testing labs in the nation to review the technologies deployed in our pilots. These audits are ongoing, and due to the ever-evolving nature of threats, repeated examinations of this kind are critical in our pursuit of security as a continuous exercise. We remain committed to providing as much transparency as possible about our system, which is why we encourage the research community to participate in our public bug bounty program hosted on HackerOne. This program grants qualified security researchers access to the latest versions of the Voatz mobile voting platform to report vulnerabilities and provide us valuable feedback. We also offer the opportunity to probe deeper for more qualified researchers. We encourage the research community to actively participate in our bug bounty program as it ensures that any issues detected are specific to Voatz in the context of a real-world environment, and that issues reported are able to be demonstrated with evidence that can be used to improve the security of our platform. Testing or probing non-Voatz owned and operated infrastructure components that have been created and configured outside of Voatz is not a genuine method to test the Voatz environment. We continue to pursue comprehensive security measures as we evolve as a company, and we take any reports of the existence of vulnerabilities in our mobile voting platform with the highest degree of scrutiny and concern. All of this is in pursuit of our mission ‚Äî that every citizen has the right to vote safely and securely regardless of their circumstances.",,,,

Solving the problem of analysis of tons of data in form of videos. Technology: Harnessing the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence. Detect any change in SOPs using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Activity Recognition: Video analysis tasks have been shifting from deducing the present situation to forecasting the future situation. Vision-based Action Recognition is used to deduce human actions in present state, based upon complete action executions, and action prediction to predict human actions in future state based upon incomplete action executions. These two tasks have become particularly widespread recently because of their emerging real-world applications, such as mopping detection, wiping detection, talking on phone, aggressive behaviour detection, etc. Facial Recognition: Facial recognition is a category of biometric software that maps an individual s facial features mathematically and stores the data as a faceprint. The software uses deep learning algorithms to compare a live capture or digital image to the stored faceprint in order to verify an individual s identity. With advancements in technology, it is now a viable option for authentication as well as identification. Face recognition is one of the few biometric methods that possess the merits of both high accuracy and low intrusiveness. Its use cases include face ID, photograph tagging, smart advertisements by identifying face ID, authentication and security. Object Detection: The goal of object detection is to notice or discover the presence of real-world objects within an image or video frame and to be able to tell an object apart from the static background. Object detection algorithms typically use extracted features and learning algorithms to recognize instances of an object category. It is commonly used in applications such as image retrieval, security, surveillance, and automated vehicle parking systems. Some use cases of object detection include face recognition, object tracking and anomaly detection. Posture Detection: Posture is a way in which a human holds his body so that there is less strain on muscles during movement. Posture detection is done by determining three dimensional orientations by tracking the movement and orientation of a body with respect to a custom axes. Its use cases include real-time posture detection (talking on the phone, aggressive behavior, etc.), kinect and 3D camera based body posture detection. Pattern Detection: Pattern recognition is a programmed or learned ability to recognise patterns within data sets. It is a fast developing field, which underpins developments in fields such as computer vision, image processing, text and document analysis and neural networks. Machines are trained to recognize the required images based on a particular pattern like recognizing a person s face based on a particular pattern. Video streams provide us access to rich temporal patterns which are captured using AI. These temporal patterns present us with various spatial patterns which are used in applications like activity recognition, event detection/classification, anomaly detection, activity based person identification etc. Powering innovation across multiple industrial sectors.

Tap into the growing motherlode of machine learning. Discover value you didn t know you had. INTUITIVE AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING FOR YOUR BUSINESS. Zorroa automatically organizes all your digital visual assets - documents, images, and video - so valuable insights are always just a quick search away. Put the latest advances in machine learning to work to analyze and extract the valuable data hidden within these assets, regardless of where they are stored - from server farms to the cloud. INTUITIVE: You don t need a PhD to use complex machine learning tools. The Zorroa Visual Intelligence platform is built to be user-friendly, so anyone can get meaningful insights from their visual assets. FLEXIBLE: Use the best algorithms available to analyze your domain-specific problems - you can even easily deploy multiple algorithms across your distributed asset collections. AUTOMATIC: Visual data - documents, images, and video - is your fastest growing asset. Keep it organized with automatic analysis, tagging, and sorting, so you can quickly browse and search all your assets when you need to find them. FUTURE-PROOF: Stay current with improvements in machine learning technology that continually provide new ways to analyze and monetize your assets, so you can make the most of these machine learning algorithms now and in the future. PLACES YOU CAN FIND ZORROA. OIL AND GAS: Mine and Explore Your Own Data Repository. Analyze all your proprietary unstructured data to make better business decisions. Zorroa s established domain expertise in the analysis of visual assets is now enabling oil and gas companies to make better, faster decisions, and dramatically reduce the time and cost of asset discovery. Through the use of Zorroa Visual Intelligence (ZVI), companies can maximize the value of their unstructured data automatically and access it through a single-view browser interface. It is ideal for geologists, geophysicists, and analysts to consider every piece of data available when making critical decisions. In many cases, companies own a wealth of visual assets in dark, legacy data files accumulated over decades which are impossible to manually analyze. At the same time, analysts are managing a huge influx of unstructured visual data from drone footage, downhole sensors, and other internet-enabled field technology. Due to this ever increasing repository of visual assets, analysts are unable to leverage huge portions of their data when making high-risk and high-stakes decisions. For example, an analyst looking to acquire a piece of land may have 90 days to give an estimate of value. The land is in a region that is restricted to exploration, but her company has documents from prospecting the area years ago‚Äîin paper files that were recently digitized with no attached metadata. In this situation, her buying offer is determined by whatever she finds manually searching through digital documents and a fair amount of guesswork. With ZVI, an analyst with no special training can maximize the value of her company s visual assets with machine learning, whether they are scanned paper files or unstructured images. Data quality can be enhanced by matching known metadata and external databases to the assets, so they can be easily searched based on a range of metrics including date prospected, well type, basin, GPS location, and more. ZVI s flexibility allows the analyst to search and inspect millions of visual assets across fragmented data silos in minutes, all accessible in an intuitive interface. To inform her purchasing decision, she can pull relevant information from dark data in minutes based on optical character recognition correlated with GPS data. Searching a particular region will give her a comprehensive view of the well logs, microphotography, core photography, progress charts, seismic profiles, and anything else that she might need to assess value of the specific area, regardless of where that data is stored. ZVI automatically organizes incoming visual assets including seismic surveys, land lease agreements, planning documents, and maintenance records so they can be searched quickly at any time. As a partner to oil and gas companies, Zorroa enables customers to future proof their investment in artificial intelligence with the most up-to-date technology, on-location or in the cloud. See what Zorroa Visual Intelligence can do for your company. MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT: From Big Screen to Big Data. Helping organizations understand and monetize massive collections of visual assets. With a combined 280 years of experience in the media and entertainment industry, Zorroa s team provides users an added layer of monetizable business intelligence to their digital content. Zorroa Visual Intelligence (ZVI) enables users to organize, search, and find the assets they need in an intuitive interface with no technical training. Companies with millions of images and video assets hold enormous value in their unstructured data, much of which remains untapped because extracting this value is reliant on employees  time and memory. With ZVI, anyone interested in finding specific content can execute advanced unstructured discovery on all their assets, providing the user with a unified view of results in a matter of seconds. For example, if an editor is looking for a specific effect for a movie, they can decide to invest two to three weeks to recreate it‚Äîor search for one they already have. With ZVI, the editor can use visual cues to search and instantly find every available option for that type of effect. Zorroa s flexibility allows users to leverage multiple machine learning tools, including facial recognition, natural language processing, and optical character recognition to enrich their search. ZVI can apply these tools wherever the assets are already stored‚Äîon premise, in the cloud, or in a production tracking software like Shotgun. Zorroa s plug-and-play architecture gives users access to the best-in-class algorithms and a future-proof investment in machine learning. As more content is analyzed and automatically organized, ZVI learns more about an organization and its assets. Metadata automatically generated during this process makes the assets more usable and monetizable to all relevant departments in an organization. THERE S VALUE IN YOUR DATA. LET US PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET. Zorroa has licensing options to suit your business ‚Äî whether you require a secure cloud-hosted or on-premise solution. HOW WILL ZORROA IMPROVE YOUR BUSINESS? Intuitive applications of machine learning can provide a competitive edge to any business with a large number of visual assets. You need the right tools to understand your data - Zorroa can help. Machine learning made simple for the enterprise. ZORROA S UNIQUE POSITIONING. Why is Zorroa different? Most digital asset analysis companies don t provide any way for you to actually utilize their results. They don t provide mechanisms that let you leverage their analysis in search and organization across your repositories, or amplify the utility of that analysis by joining data from structured databases. At the same time, most MAM and DAM solutions don t provide integrated machine learning analysis to extract insights and metadata from your assets. When they do, it s typically a handful of standard, pre-packaged analysis models that you can t change.  They don t provide a way to create custom analysis, chain together multiple algorithms, apply 3rd party models‚Äîor even train your own neural nets‚Äîto target your very own tough, domain-specific problems. They typically don t even let you do multi-modal search with multiple keywords. Zorroa Visual Intelligence does all of these things. Why does that difference matter? Simple asset analysis is only good for solving simple problems. Assset analysis that isn t integrated with organization, search and discovery is hardly useful at all. Zorroa is a system for targeting difficult, specific problems, creating impactful and measurable solutions, then making those solutions easy and automatic across vast and distributed asset collections. Why is that hard for existing computer vision companies to replicate? We are unique in attacking this space with a mindset developed from working successfully in the world of Visual FX. We share a worldview in which real value‚Äîthe kind of value that clearly distinguishes one company s solutions as being superior to its competition‚Äîcomes from being able to routinely create unexpected, elegant solutions for what was thought to be impossible. OPTIMAL ANALYSIS WITH MULTIPLE ALGORITHMS Zorroa s open, plug-in pipeline architecture allows you to utilize multiple algorithms simultaneously, enabling you to get the best search results, no matter the size, quality, or nature of your assets. ZVI can provide character recognition, image processing, metadata enrichment from structured databases, and more‚Äîall accessible within one dashboard. ENHANCED SEARCHABILITY Your digital visual assets are most valuable when they are well described and organized. Zorroa can enhance your current documents, images, and video and automatically organize new assets by attaching pertinent information from structured databases, so they can be searched and browsed successfully across more dimensions. CUSTOMIZED DIGITAL ASSET ANALYSIS The problems you are trying to solve with document, image, and video analysis are specific to your business, and your visual assets are unique. Unlike most solutions which offer generic, unmodifiable analysis, Zorroa leverages a combination of processors, so your business always has the most advanced and customizable analysis available. AUTOMATICALLY ORGANIZE ASSETS To make the most of your visual assets, which continue to grow exponentially over time, these documents, images, and video need to be consistently analyzed, tagged, and sorted.
