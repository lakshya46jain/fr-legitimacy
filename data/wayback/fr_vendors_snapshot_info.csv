We use AI to see, hear and understand how patients respond to treatment. Everyone responds differently to disease and treatment. We are working to understand how. We developed IMA, an interactive medical assistant to assist patients and ensure they receive treatment. IMA aggregates data so you can have access to meaningful clinical insights. Adherence, Retention, Deception, and Digital Biomarkers. Unlocking the potential for new theraphies and benefiting all patients. Our AI interacts with patients We believe that visual and audio data provide the most meaningful insights into patient health. Our platform understands if treatments are working By confirming and optimizing behavior, we are able to determine if the treatment is working. Our data is used to learn and compare These data allow us to understand how drugs perform and how patients respond in clinical research and care. IMA offers new ways of measuring and predicting clinical progress: Expressivity. Treatments save lives Imagine if you could predict their course. Our unique composite measure of engagement assesses individual risk and predicts patient outcome. What does your patient s level of engagement mean? A patient with a high level of engagement. These patients dose consistently and have a high probability of staying in treatment. They respond to targeted interventions and micro-payments. High risk of dropout. Unlike patients who are highly engaged, these patients are inconsistent with their dosing, may be enrolled at poor performing sites or clinics, and are at risk of discontinuing treatment. Deliberate Nonadherence. Some patients who enroll in clinical trials have no intention of taking the drug being tested. AiCure is the first technology to have visual evidence of this behavior in clinical trials. Use our data to target high-risk patients. A global view into site and clinic performance. Data insights can make all the difference. Peer-reviewed publications: Real-word evidence & Cost effectiveness. Clinical Trial Methodology. Built on a foundation of longitudinal patient data.

See our peer-reviewed publications: In drug development, we are defining new methodologies and enrichment strategies Clear value is essential in understanding the application of new technology. AiCure s value is structured around four key pillars: data integrity; lower variability; predictive composite measures; and increases in statistical power. Incorporating these data pillars into study design allows for faster, smaller trials. AiCure is also demonstrating significant results by introducing new trial methodologies such as placebo lead-in periods, micro-reimbursements, and other approaches directly correlated with patient engagement and clinical endpoints. For payors, we are reducing medical costs and waste Medication adherence is one of the few parameters in healthcare that is directly linked to medical costs. AiCure has demonstrated significant savings for some of the largest payors and states by ensuring high-risk patient populations stay on therapy. For science and the healthcare industry, we are developing novel clinical endpoints through computational diagnostics AiCure is pioneering a new set of tools to help researchers and clinicians understand and predict how patients respond to treatment. Advances in artificial intelligence allow computers to capture physiological datapoints that characterize expressivity, psychomotor function, and cognition. Whether a patient has schizophrenia or congestive heart failure, the degree to which they are able to adhere and respond to treatment depends in great part on their mood, their ability to move and to concentrate.

At Aindra, we are building a world where Clinical Pathology is Data driven, Fast and Patient focused. Why? 5.8 billion people. That is the number of people on the planet who today, do not have access to a reliable and high quality healthcare. While inaccessibility is the problem facing the developing world, expensive machines and treatment methods are driving healthcare costs uncomfortably high in the developed countries. And we want to change this broken healthcare system. We at Aindra, are a passionate bunch of technophiles. We re trying to converge the best technologies to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, as it s supposed to be.  Affordable healthcare solutions for all  is our ethos. How? At, Aindra Systems, our goal is to democratise access to quality healthcare, by using deep technology to realise our vision of accessible and affordable healthcare solutions. As technology enthusiasts, we believe the impact of leveraging technologies like Artificial Intelligence in the right way, can deliver more smarter, quicker and reliable systems that will help overcome the existing challenges of the healthcare system. What? Our AI platform Astra, is built to detect critical illnesses such as Cancer. Astra is a powerful platform that can be extended to build detection tools for a number of critical illnesses. As the first beachhead, we have developed a point-of-care detection system for Cervical Cancer that is quick, affordable and accessible. CervAstra will enable women to walk-in to their nearest primary health center, get screened and walk out with their reports. It is that simple. Our intelligent screening system CervAstra, tailwinds the development and striking benefits of computational pathology. Our Technology. Faster diagnosis: Why AI? The biggest reason is because today, multiple factors have converged to create an environment where AI can make discoveries and judgments leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses than humans can perform. It significantly reduces the turnaround time for reports and also enables pathologists to look at only the relevant data. Farther outreach: Healthcare Inclusion. Diagnostic centers are concentrated in the larger cities, whereas most of the population resides in smaller cities or villages. Our compact systems are portable that can be carried to the point- of care. Our technology enables the healthcare system to extend itself into the far reaches of any country. Increased throughput: Fatigued and limited pathologists, cause a delay in reports, and increase the number of misdiagnoses leading to enormous social & economic costs. There is also an shortage of specialists at many medical institutions. There is a need for an AI imaging diagnosis support system that can interpret images, detect small lesions that even specialists could miss. AI eliminates the grunt work of looking at 80% normal samples. Feedback learning: Through intelligent architecting of the system, the AI algorithms are continuously learning from human intervention when Pathologists either confirm or reject the findings of the algorithms. These are then automatically redirected back as feedback, to build even better Deep Learning models. If data is the life blood of any Deep Learning system, our system ensures that there is a constant supply of supervised data that goes into building better models.",,,,

This is how we do it. 10x-15x ROI According to Customer-Provided Estimates With implementations with tier-one financial institutions worldwide, BioCatch behavioral biometrics has proven to deliver tremendous returns on investment once deployed. Traditional fraud prevention tools fall short of addressing the sophisticated methods that fraudsters are employing today. In fact, most fraud today comes either from using synthetic or stolen IDs or after the login. As a result, the savings attributed to BioCatch may reach millions of dollars per month, with very high fraud detection performance rates. As impressive as these values are, they represent only part of the big picture. Other less-quantifiable value dimensions such as user satisfaction and preventing user abandonment by minimizing false positives are just as significant, if not more. Using well-established methodologies that look at actual fraud savings as well as operational savings due to fewer escalations and step up authentication protocols, business line managers, fraud prevention departments and information security officers can apply a predictable and rational model for the best way to apply behavioral biometrics in their organizations. The value quantification process can be utilized at any organization not only to assess the actual business value for behavioral biometrics, but also to optimize the set of fraud detection solutions deployed, the set-up, and their threshold settings. In addition to tremendous savings, behavioral biometrics may also accelerate the deployment of new applications and offerings, reduce risk, increase management confidence and create new growth opportunities.

OUR STORY BioCatch was founded in 2011 by experts in neural science research, machine learning and cybersecurity. Today we re redefining digital identity and enabling secure and seamless online experiences through innovation in AI-driven behavioral biometrics. The Leader in AI-Driven Behavioral Biometrics BioCatch was founded in 2011 by experts in neural science, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and cyberterrorism. The newly-founded company had a significant mission: to address next-generation digital identity challenges by focusing on online user behavior rather than static authentication measures, like passwords or endpoint security. They discovered an untapped goldmine. Powerful behavioral insights ‚Äî gleaned from the analysis of more than 2,000 physical and cognitive behavioral parameters ‚Äî were able to support different use cases across the digital identity lifecycle. The technology enabled the holy grail of the modern digital era ‚Äî seamless and secure online experiences. Behavioral biometrics, a technology used to identify people based on their behavioral parameters, was born. BioCatch founder Avi Turgeman began pursuing a theory that people interact with machines in unique, measurable ways while serving in military intelligence. Drawing on years of experience exploring white-hat hacking, system vulnerability management and cyberterrorist operations, Turgeman turned his attention to online fraudsters and their identifiable signatures, co-founding BioCatch with Benny Rosenbaum. In developing their AI-driven platform to passively identify both human and non-human behaviors online, BioCatch upended the paradigm of having to choose between security and convenience. Today, the company continues its commitment to innovation through an unparalleled IP portfolio of more than 60 granted or pending patents. The BioCatch platform is deployed by major banks and other global enterprises to help manage their digital identity challenges.

Its management team, representing over 20 years of experience in developing and implementing biometrics-based technology solutions across vertical markets, focuses the company on identity solutions that match specific customer requirements rather than championing any individual technology. BioID Projects BioID Technologies markets its solutions to Government (Immigration and Public Safety), Aviation / Transportation and Financial Services. The company recognizes the following market requirements driving implementation in these markets: 1.Scalable identification performance 2.User convenience 3.Modular architectures that allow for flexibility in deploying individual biometric and security technologies. 4.Return on Investment, as the key parameter in any business case, is the single most important driver in biometric market development. Hajj Project Pilgrims (KSA) Having successfully completed the first large-scale Iris Identification project at the Hajj Airport for Pilgrims on their yearly visit to Mecca in early 2002, BioID Technologies is successfully extending that experience to further Airports (Border Control) where rapid enrollment and (token-less) identification is key. UNHCR Refugee Identification System Working with the United Nations in Geneva (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and in cooperation with Iridian Technologies, BioID developed a Refugee Identification System for the UNHCR operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2002. Its purpose is to prevent refugee from applying multiple times for UNHCR travel assistance. By developing and implementing an anonymous Iris Recognition enrollment application, individuals that apply twice (recyclers) are identified within seconds without the need of tokens or ID documents. The project is operational covering multiple sites across Pakistan and Afghanistan and with more than 950,000 individuals enrolled it constitutes the larges Iris Recognition implementation to date and be expanded to 1.000,000 individuals during the course of 2006. UNDP Registration System DR Congo In 2004 BioID implemented a turnkey registration system for UNCP in DR Congo. In order to carry out the registration, identification and subsequent data management, UNDP has implemented a biometric registration and identification system combined with an ID card issue and database management component and central database for registering 20.000 ex-combatants in Five Transit Sites in the region of Ituri (north-east of DRC). The pilot was extended to a rollout across 23 sites in Congo during 2005 and 2006 with currently 140 000 individuals enrolled. BioID has provided UNDP a turnkey solution including the design, development and installation of the DDR Registration System. BioID is provides an integrated system: 1.Register ex-combatants with Iris Recognition 2.Identify individuals based on Iris Recognition 3.Input and manage personal records 4.Personalize and print  ID cards 5.Manage transactional information related to benefits distribution 6.Provide a management reporting function Afghan Civil and Voter Registration Pilot Project The CVR project was a component of UNDP Enhancing Legal and Electoral Capacity for Tomorrow (ELECT) Project to provide support to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) of Afghanistan in becoming a fiscally and institutionally sustainable administration with high integrity, capacity and resources to undertake elections in an increasingly fiscally sustainable manner by end-2008. For maximum utility of resources, a Joint Civil and Voter Registry project will produce an accurate and comprehensive national database of all its citizens. The national database will be used to produce and issue a national Identify document to all Afghan citizens that will serve as proof of identity. The national database and ID will serve multiple government departments will the government of Afghanistan eliminate various forms of identity fraud. The solution developed for the UNDP Afghan CVR project is based on a hybrid biometric system using iris recognition as well as face recognition systems.",,,,

OUR STORY: In 2013 while studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Bocholt, Germany the question was raised whether there was an indoor positioning system existent or not. After discussing advantages of such a system, we concluded that there was no system available because GPS usually isn t working indoors. I personally kept thinking about it and how to commercialise such an idea. Then, in 2015 at the University of Queensland I stumbled across a laser technology which was used to automate flying drones. From the very first second, I was taken back to the time when we discussed the indoor positioning system a few years ago. I started looking into vision technologies and created a minimum viable product (MVP) in 2016. Throughout the past 12 months we have discovered various use cases for vision technologies in factories, warehouses, and retail.

163,BrainChip Holdings Ltd.,Australia,2013,Public,1,1,1,1,1,0,https://www.brainchipinc.com/,,,"BrainChip is the leading provider of neuromorphic computing solutions, a type of artificial intelligence that is inspired by the biology of the human neuron - spiking neural networks. Our spiking neural network technology can learn autonomously, evolve and associate information just like the human brain. We have recently unveiled the Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip. Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip The AkidaTM NSoC is both low cost and low power, making it ideal for edge applications such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous vehicles, drones, vision-guided robotics, surveillance and machine vision systems. Its scalability allows users to connect many Akida devices together to perform complex neural network training and inference for cybersecurity and financial technology (FinTech) applications. Biologically Inspired, Digitally Engineered. The Akida NSoC is the first in a revolutionary new breed of neuromorphic computing devices. Inspired by the biological function of neurons but engineered on a digital logic process, these spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inherently lower power than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). SNN replace the math-intensive convolutions and back-propagation training methods of CNNs with neuron functions and feed-forward training methodologies. BrainChip s research has determined the optimal neuron model and training methods, bringing unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. Each Akida NSoC has effectively 1.2 million neurons and 10 billion synapses, representing 100 times better efficiency than neuromorphic test chips from Intel and IBM. Comparisons to leading CNN accelerator devices show similar performance gains of an order of magnitude better images/second/watt running industry standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 with comparable accuracy. BrainChip Studio and Accelerator BrainChip Studio and BrainChip Accelerator utilize our neuromorphic computing technology to provide video analytics solutions for law enforcement and intelligence organizations. Because it rapidly learns new objects, patterns, and faces, it can quickly search vast amounts of video footage for previously unknown suspects. BrainChip Studio aids law enforcement and intelligence organizations to rapidly search vast amounts of video footage and identify patterns or faces. A result of over 10 years of R&D, it uses an artificial intelligence (AI) technology called a spiking neural network (SNN), a type of neuromorphic computing that simulates the functionality of the human visual tract. Because faces have unique identifying features, the software includes advanced facial detection, extraction and classification algorithms. The SNN technology enables BrainChip Studio to work on low-resolution video and requires only a 24x24 pixel image to detect and classify faces. BrainChip Studio runs on standard x86-based desktop and server platforms with most common video file formats. It is currently available to select law enforcement and intelligence agencies. BrainChip Accelerator is an 8-lane, PCI-Express add-in card that increases the speed and accuracy of the object recognition function of BrainChip Studio software by up to six times. It does this by accelerating video scaling, spike generation, and spiking neuron model comparisons. In combination with a CPU that has 16 virtual cores, BrainChip Accelerator can process 16 channels of video simultaneously, with an effective throughput of over 600 frames per second. The low-power characteristics of BrainChip s spiking neural technology results in a power-sipping 15 watts total consumption. This results in a lower total cost of ownership compared to using additional servers. The Akida Development Environment The AkidaTM Development Environment is a complete machine learning framework for the Revolutionary Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NSoC). The AkidaTM Development Environment is a complete machine learning framework for the creation, training, and testing of spiking neural networks (SNNs), supporting the development of systems for edge and enterprise products on the Company s Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NSoC). The Akida Development Environment includes the Akida Execution Engine, data-to-spike converters, and a model zoo of pre-created spiking neural network (SNN) models. The framework leverages the Python scripting language and its associated tools and libraries, including Jupyter notebooks, NumPy and Matplotlib. Akida Execution Engine The Akida Execution Engine is at the center of the framework and contains a software simulation of the Akida neuron, synapses, and the multiple supported training methodologies. Easily accessed through API calls in a Python script, users can specify their neural network topologies, training method, and datasets for execution. Based on the structure of the Akida neuron, the execution engine supports multiple training methods, including unsupervised training and unsupervised training with a labelled final layer. Data to Spike Converters Spiking neural networks work on spike patterns. The development environment natively accepts spiking data created by Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). However, there are many other types of data that can be used with SNNs. Embedded in the Akida Execution Engine are data-to-spike converters, which convert common data formats such as image information (pixels) into the spikes required for an SNN. The development environment will initially ship with a pixel-to-spike data converter, to be followed by converters for audio and big data requirements in cybersecurity, financial information and the Internet-of-Things data. Users are also able to create their own proprietary data to spike converters to be used within the development environment. A Large Addressable Market BrainChip s artificial intelligence technology is inherently low-power, quickly trained, and works in challenging environments. Because our technology is trained, not explicitly programmed, it can be used in a variety of applications. Vision Systems The Akida NSoC can be used in any embedded vision system for object recognition. Applications include ADAS/AV, drones, vision guided robotics, and machine vision. Cybersecurity In cybersecurity applications, the Akida NSoC is a powerful accelerator for packet inspection, malware, and anomaly detection. Financial Technology Using an innovative unsupervised learning methodology, the Akida NSoC can perform clustering to find patterns in large amounts of unlabeled financial data. Civil Surveillance: Forensic Object Search and Facial Classification BrainChip Studio and BrainChip Accelerator helps law enforcement and intelligence organizations to rapidly search vast amounts of video footage and identify patterns. BrainChip Studio includes advanced facial detection, extraction and classification algorithms. The spiking neural network technology enables BrainChip Studio to work on low-resolution video, and requires only a 24x24 pixel image to detect and classify faces. Casino Solutions BrainChip has created a custom card and chip recognition system with its partner Gaming Partners International. The accuracy of the system is unparalleled, with over 99% accuracy rate. Limitless Application Possibilities Our technology is not application specific, but a core enabling technology for neuromorphic computing. Because it is low-power, our technology can be used in nearly any embedded system. Beyond the previously described applications, neuromoprhic computing can be used in potentially unlimited applications such as smartphones, speech recognition, the Internet of Things (IoT), and agricultural technology among others. A Technology that Learns Like the Human Brain - Neuromorphic Computing BrainChip s technology uses a type of neuromorphic computing called spiking neural networks (SNNs). It has many attractive characteristics, including the ability to be trained rapidly, high accuracy and low compute overhead. This is an important feature in the world outside of the internet, where massive datasets are not available. For instance, a police department looking for a suspect in live video streams does not have thousands of images of that suspect, nor does it have weeks to train a traditional convolutional neural network system. What Makes Our Technology So Exciting Our technology learns from experience, autonomously, just like a human. Deep Learning networks are power-hungry and require large GPU-Server clusters and weeks of training. BrainChip s SNNs can learn in an unsupervised manner, without large datasets, and finds patterns that humans may not be aware of. This rapid learning capability opens up new possibilities to find objects in video, patterns in large datasets, and hundreds of other applications. Because SNNs can be implemented using regular logic functions, they are inherently high-performance and low-power. How It Works Spiking neural networks are inherently feed-forward networks, for both training and inference. Our neuron models learn through selective reinforcement or inhibition of synaptic connections and programmable firing thresholds. Ingrained in these models are innovative training methodologies for supervised and unsupervised training. In the supervised mode, the initial layers of the network train themselves autonomously, while in the final fully-connected layers, labels can be applied, enabling these networks to function as classification networks. The Akida NSoC is designed to perform either on-chip training or off-chip training in the Akida Development Environment. A Leader in Neuromorphic Computing Neuromorphic computing is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the functionality of the human neuron. At BrainChip, we have developed a revolutionary spiking neural network (SNN) technology, a type of neuromorphic computing that learns autonomously, evolves and associates information just like the human brain. BrainChip s first application of this technology is the award-winning BrainChip Studio and BrainChip Accelerator, which aids law enforcement and intelligence organizations to rapidly search vast amounts of video footage and identify objects or faces. The Akida Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NSoC) is the first in a new breed of neuromorphic computing chips that puts artificial intelligence at the edge and the enterprise.",,,,

170,Cainthus,Ireland,2015,Private,1,0,0,1,0,0,https://www.cainthus.com,,,"THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION IN AGRICULTURE IS HERE. At Cainthus we are working hand in hand with farmers to develop the world s most advanced technology for dairy farms today. Technology that s transformational for animals, farmers and the production of food. Using computer vision and artificial intelligence, our smart cameras observe nutritional, behavioural, health and environmental activities that can impact production. We translate this visual information into actionable insights that enable the farmer to make data-driven decisions to improve farm operations and animal health. ANIMAL BENEFITS. Cows are clear communicators if we know what to look for. Comfort is central to the health and well-being of dairy cows, and though they may not have the ability to speak, they give out clear signals that we can observe and alert the farmer to if intervention is needed, ensuring their comfort is always top priority. FARMER BENEFITS.  I want to manage every cow like it s my only cow . As farms continue to consolidate, labor shortages increase and herd sizes grow, more and more farmers are turning to technology to help them watch over their business. ALUS watches 24/7 so you don t have to. FOOD PRODUCTION BENEFITS. ""Consumers have never cared more or known less about where their food comes from"" ‚Äì Jack Bobo. Transparency in the supply chain from farm to fork is key to consumer confidence, and the ability to observe cow comfort 24/7 means the consumer need not have any welfare concerns relating to how their food is produced. Our vision, your success. At Cainthus our vision is for a world of sustainable abundance. By providing meaningful measurement for food production and animal well-being on-farm, we believe this can lead to a better life for all. We are a computer vision and artificial intelligence company based in Dublin, California and Ottawa. We combine unparalleled expertize and cutting-edge innovation, to passively monitor your cows 24/7 and analyze their well-being, productivity and performance, alerting you when it matters most. Farmers First: Although Cainthus roots are steeped in agriculture, we know that farmers today have the benefit of hindsight when it comes to herd management, and it s this knowledge, passed down from generation to generation, that is the key to turning hindsight into foresight. Our Story: Coming from a small village in rural Ireland and growing up in a family that owns Ireland s largest grain importer and exporter, Comex McKinnon, David and Ross Hunt have a rich background in agriculture. Post college, Ross worked in accounting before he entered the family business while David initially pursued a career in corporate banking. Despite his success in the sector, he found it to be an unsatisfying profession and after five years decided to close the book on his banking career. Our Team: Building effective teams with the right attitude emanates from the highest levels of an organization. At Cainthus we operate with a spirit of openness and collaboration, spearheaded by our leadership. Teams are not born, they are built, and team spirit comes from the top. An eye on your farm, an eye on your future. Technology in one form, or another has existed on dairy farms for many years and farmers are a very  tech-savvy  group when it comes to understanding the benefits data-driven decisions can make to their operations. Combining computer vision and artificial intelligence. At Cainthus we are building a computer vision (CV) enabled product that can be installed on dairy farms. We combine CV and deep learning to monitor animal behavior as well as operations on the farm. Our smart camera system has the ability to make observations 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we build intelligence into that monitoring, similar to a humans ability to watch what is happening. System features allow the farmer to do things like set an alert for changes to the farm management plan, and then we can do trend analyses to understand where there is room for improvement. Our easy-to-use software delivers daily notifications to your phone or computer and provides access to detailed analytics that can inform the actions you need to take to improve milk production and animal well-being.",,,,

Supporting responsible gaming and safe casinos Casinos worldwide are using real-time face recognition to alert security staff of banned persons, and of patrons enrolled in voluntary exclusion programs who have asked to be stopped at the entrance. High rollers can receive special treatment as they are recognized at the entrance. Gaming facilities can use facial analysis for an initial age check to avoid paying high fines for underage visitors. The software also detects gamblers who are staying too long in the casino, or within a certain area of the gaming floor. Alerting retail staff to shoplifters, minors, and valued customers Retailers use face recognition to support their security measures, while providing more personalized shopping experiences. A database with persons of interest‚Äîwhether you stop them from entering or greet them in person‚Äîcan be shared among multiple stores. Curtail underage sales violations, and avoid fine payments and license revocations! Anonymous facial analysis computes visitor statistics, e.g., footfall during peak times, or in certain areas of the store. Use visitor data for staffing and other operational decisions! Analyzing guest footfall, visit length and frequency Restaurants want to know more about guest count and behaviour, and can use anonymous facial analysis to collect precise data about when, how often and for which duration guests visit their premises. Restaurant chains can determine if patrons frequent various locations. In addition, restaurant businesses could allow customers to self-enroll in a valued guest database, and then recognize and greet them upon entry. Another gallery may collect images of persons who are banned from entering the premises. Posting instant watch list alerts, and managing people flow Face recognition adds another security layer to border control and airport security procedures by checking watch lists in real time and providing instant notifications when a known person is seen by a camera. FaceVACS-VideoScan can detect crowds and measure waiting times in specific areas to prompt the redirection of people traffic. Airports also use the technology to assess journey times through the airport, using the data to change airport design, and evaluate staff and process performance. Preventing disruption, injury, and destruction of property Adding cameras along with a face recognition system to stadium entrances complements other security measures to keep criminals and violent fans from entering the event facility. Event management can use statistical information derived from facial analysis to measure visitor counts and distribution, and use footfall data and person demographics to evaluate past and plan future events.Greeting customers with more than a smile Banks can recognize their customer upon entry and greet them by name and with their account details at hand. Daily reports about customer count and frequency supports planning for staff resources and branch capacities. In the long run, banks can use such statistics to inform future business strategies.

Hi, I am Joanna, Mom & Cubo AI Co-founder. After 6 IVF attempts, I finally met this little miracle. So when I found my baby s face accidentally covered, I couldn t sleep for months. When even 6 cameras couldn t ease my worries, we partnered with Dr. Kenneth Yeh to design a proactive smart baby monitor for worried parents like me! With a mission to protect every baby in the world, we co-created Cubo AI s proprietary technology to proactively warn parents of dangerous situations such as Covered Face events so parents can step in when needed. We designed every Cubo AI feature to enhance baby safety and keep lasting memories. I m so excited to bring peace of mind and joy to your parenting journey! Hi, I m Dr. Kenneth Yeh, Pediatrician & Cubo AI s medical consultant. For me, everything started when I began noticing how many parents asked me about making sure babies sleep safely at night. There s a lot to be said about sleep safety, but the best advice I could give was that babies should be laid to sleep on their backs. Given newborns can spend an entire day sleeping, it s incredibly important that they sleep in the correct posture and that parents employ safe sleeping practices. I was really excited when Cubo AI team reached out to me! We made a good team because we had a common goal of keeping babies safe. I provided professional medical guidance and Cubo AI worked on the technology. Sleep Safety: Our Common Goal. The World s First Smart Parenting Assistant. A baby monitor that is created by parents and designed for babies. 93% of 6182 parents reported better peace of mind. We spent more than a year carrying out over 8000 questionnaires and 158 in-depth interviews to understand what parents wanted. After extensive testing and iterations of various prototypes, we finally arrived at Cubo AI: the world s smartest AI Baby Monitor. Cubo AI s development hasn t just been one team s effort, it is a culmination of the experience and expectations of parents globally. Our common goal: helping babies everywhere grow up safely. It all began in 2017 when a team of parents and experts in AI, hardware and software with over 15 years collective experience came together with the common goal of helping to protect babies everywhere grow up safely.

FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE: AUREUS 3D-AI DELIVERS FAST, ACCURATE, SCALABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE In 1966 a mathematician and computer scientist named Woody Bledsoe was assigned by a US intelligence agency to find a way for a computer to utilize facial recognition. The problem was, given a large database of images (a book of mug shots) and a photograph (another mug-shot), it was challenging to determine a match. Fifty years later, facial recognition still refers to a computer system that matches two images of faces. The difference is we re now searching databases scaling to hundreds of millions of images, and the ""photograph ""is now a live video stream. CyberExtruder approaches the problem of matching faces from a vastly different perspective ‚Äì3 dimensions (3D). The approach is unique enough to be granted patents and acknowledged by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as providing increased results over conventional (2D) matching efforts.

The newest crop of processors has produced a generation of cameras capable of a wide range of analytic activities. Aureus 3D is compatible with these cameras, and provides enhanced identification and situational awareness for biometric security systems. FACIAL RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS ‚Äì SAAS CLOUD-BASED We encourage developers of SaaS and cloud-based facial recognition applications to give Aureus 3D a thorough review. Whether your goal is to verify a person s identity or identify unknown individuals, we have the right solution for you. CyberExtruder excels at understanding customer goals and co-operatively working to bring the clients  vision to life. FORENSIC ANALYSIS AND FACE RECOGNITION Law enforcement and intelligence agents frequently must analyze video as part of forensic analysis when investigating criminal activity. In the past, low-resolution video cameras combined with the need for identification matches to be made manually relegated video evidence to a role of being slow and time-consuming. Aureus 3Df is the worlds fastest facial recognition software. FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY Every conversation about facial recognition begins with  How accurate is it?  and this is just not a simple question to answer. There are multiple factors and multiple variables within each use case which will impact the answer to the question. Fortunately, CyberExtruder has approached the challenge of biometric-based face matching in a very different way than everyone else. The cornerstone of this is our patented 2D to 3D transformational process which mitigates a lot of the variables that can negatively impact matching scores. Then layer in our proprietary deep convolutional neural networks, and the result is a face matching system which is uniquely fast and accurate by design, flexible in use and scalable for tomorrow because what we can uncover about a face as it transforms from 2D to 3D allows us to solve problems no one has yet considered. Facial recognition search performed on video presents levels of difficulty not seen in controlled environments because subjects may be absent for extended periods, with cluttered backgrounds yielding false face detections in other algorithms. Subjects are not only in motion, but the direction they are moving is not optimal for face matching purposes. Motion can cause blurring which means that to be effective, algorithms have to track faces through time. This task is further complicated by busy backgrounds, variations in lighting and the possibility of faces being hidden (occluded) by objects or other people. Now add in the likelihood of multiple people being present in a scene each one requiring simultaneous detection, tracking, and matching.  Facial detail is degraded due to the lossy compression that is present in almost all video transmission and storage. Our answer to all these challenges is Aureus 3D and CyberExtruder s continuing program of research and development in advanced facial recognition (FR) technologies. We believe we have developed the world s fastest and most accurate face matching engine. Our performance superiority is based on our proprietary 2D to 3D face modeling technology which mitigates the challenges of pose, lighting, and expression as well as our use of convolutional neural networks which allow us to train our algorithms to deliver ever increasing performance. But it s not just about being the best at matching faces. Our approach optimizes the competitive difference of 3D over 2D technology and delivers real-time face matching is full frame rate video. Our 3D technology compensates for the pose, lighting, facial expressions, and vague images ‚Äì which are the biggest constraints to conventional FR. Our 3D technology works with any video camera, and we provide the most accurate face tracking technology anywhere. Best of all, our software is designed for easy partner integration.",https://cyberextruder.com/,230,2.00E+13,2.03E+13

THE NOTION THAT CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE PERTINENT THAN IT IS TODAY. OUR STORY. People and time: the new dynamic This is a moment in history when our most precious resource, time, is undergoing ceaseless attacks. A moment when an elemental change in how people interact with each other and new technology isn t merely a nice-to-have, but a must-have. Just look at the numbers. People exchange more than 100 trillion messages annually. Professionals spend half of their days just on email and internal knowledge management, constantly juggling applications, systems, and devices. Then there are the 4 million apps available for download and the 200 billion smart machines projected by 2020. The world is drowning in data yet 96% of organizations are failing to capture true value from it. The only thing not growing is the time we have to make sense of it all. Advanced machine intelligence is a powerful solution to today s prevailing technology headwinds. People and organizations alike struggle with productivity every day as constant distraction chips away at our time and attention. Cybersecurity threats are more numerous and costly than ever. And information overload leaves us searching for the meaning and context hidden under oceans of data. Entefy is addressing these challenges to personal and organizational productivity. Our advanced AI and communication solutions return each of us to the centers of our digital worlds. We re solving the information overload problem with next-gen machine intelligence that enables fast access to information that really matters.

Gaining us more time to discover and do more. Impact first. Everything else will follow. This is a foundational concept at Entefy. If we re going to spend time solving problems, make them the biggest hardest problems out there. Form and function Select a meaningful problem. Recruit an exceptional team. Focus on real solutions. Change people s lives. We believe that if we are going to spend time solving problems, we should make them the biggest, toughest problems we can find. Entefy helps people and organizations DiscoveR&Do more. Our team has engineered patented technologies in communication, machine intelligence, and cybersecurity that transform interactions between people, smart machines, and services. Our solutions enable next-generation collaboration, search, knowledge management, data intelligence, and AI assistance‚Äîaccelerating digital transformation to fuel growth and productivity in unprecedented ways. How do we know we ve made an impact? Using a yardstick of firsts-mosts-bests that measures success. This is how the four Forces concept arose. Big organizations need to be hierarchical because they have many specialized silos. Entefy is a different creature. At this stage, we optimize for speed, precision, and efficiency. Product Force brings the Entefy technology platform to life, Growth Force engages with customers, Talent Force ensures we have the right skills and cultural values within our team, and Business Force makes everything run smoothly. It is an entirely new way to organize a company to ensure continuous innovation. Our mission: To save you time so you can live and work better. The infinitude of human potential: 1 INNOVATION The stories of humankind s most remarkable thinkers show that more than mere necessity drives innovation. Courageous innovation is that rare breed of innovation born in environments fraught with obstacles and yet still succeeds for the benefit of all. 2 DRIVE Persistence. Grit. Moxie. Call it what you want, you know it when you see it. Drive defines that rare person with a vision to upend a paradigm or improve the understanding of the world. 3 CURIOSITY The Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman was renowned for the breadth of his interests. He said in his autobiography, ""I m always looking, like a child, for the wonders I know I m going to find."" 4 TRUST The causeway that links one person to another is trust. We see trust in the commitment of a handshake, and in fidelity to people we never meet. Many of us engage in a collaborative exercise in trust every day: the commute. 5 AGILITY Generating innovation when technology is always changing, when our understanding of the world is always changing, requires mental flexibility to rival the physicality of a ballerina or the power of a sports legend.

Rather than offer just one proctoring style, Examity s platform allows clients to select the level that best fits their needs. ID Verification: The first step in learning validation, ID verification confirms that test-takers are who they say they are. At Examity, we offer three forms of ID verification: Automated, Mobile, and Live. Automated: With Automated ID Verification, proprietary technology coupled with other factors validates the identity of test-takers. One of the most cost-effective ways to authenticate, our automated solution provides a flexible, secure, and efficient approach ID verification. Mobile: Our Mobile ID Verification solution employs smartphone technology to authenticate a test-taker s identity. One of the fastest ways to authenticate, this approach to ID verification uses fingerprint, face and voice biometrics. Live: In Live Authentication, our team will confirm a test-taker s identity, review the exam rules and inspect the test environment. Human ID verification offers the highest level of assurance that test-takers are who they say they are and abide by exam rules. Automated Proctoring: Once a test-taker s identity is confirmed, Examity software takes over to capture aberrant behavior during the exam. Two forms of automated proctoring are offered to accommodate differing security needs. Examity s proprietary machine learning algorithms are applied to detect potential violations. Any aberrant behavior is captured via screenshots, audio files, and video. For added security, clients may elect to add human auditing to further review the proctored session. Live Proctoring: Live proctoring is the most secure approach within the online proctoring industry. The Examity team monitors each exam from start to finish. Flexible and secure. Examity offers multiple forms of live proctoring to meet client needs. For added security, the Examity auditing team reviews all live sessions prior to releasing audio, video and analytics. Varying formats, including low ratio, auto-assisted (higher ratio) and recorded, meet expectations and preferences for any situation. Artificial Intelligence, Always Integrated, Superior Support. Examity s focus on flexible solutions, new technology, operational efficiencies and support has, and continues to be, our formula for continuous growth. Today, we service the largest needs in the industry. That said, our philosophy of taking care of our own ‚Äì partners and employees ‚Äì is the foundation of our success. Examity entered the online proctoring market in 2013. At the time, there were a number of providers already in the space, but each was offering a single-service style solution, e.g. auto proctoring. As we met and connected with university, certification, licensure, and pre-employment partners, we realized that a new online proctoring approach was required. We developed our solution to encompass a variety of proctoring styles, from automated through to live. In addition, we heard time and again that test-takers require immediate, and ongoing support, on their schedule. With this in mind, we built our team (now 500 strong, across 4 times zones) to provide students with 24/7 support, through familiar and accessible channels. Since 2013, we are both excited and honored to have experienced more than 50% growth, every year we have been in business. This is a validation of our success. We take great pride in our ability to handle more than 1 million assessments per year. We maintain partnerships with more than 500 enterprise testing organizations, corporations and universities. Notable partners include: Amazon, Tableau Software, Coursera, Duolingo, Kaplan, Indiana University, Penn State University, the College Board, the University of Sydney and Western Governors University.

Join over 10M users worldwide already using FacePhi. Imaging the possibility to forget using passwords and, at the same time, increasing the level of security for your identity in a friendly way, FacePhi presents inPhinite. How does it work? Biometrics Biometrics is a science that, through automated methods, is able to verify or recognize the identity of a person based on their physiology or behavioral. The concept ""biometrics"" comes from the words, bios (life) and metron (measure), which means that all biometrical devices can measure and identify personal features. Each person has morphological features that are unique and therefore, different from everyone else. Face recognition allows us to determine the identity of a person by analysing the face. Unlike other types of biometry like iris or fingerprint, face recognition is non-intrusive; it does not require cooperation from the user. It just needs to capture the face of the person with a web cam. Enrollment The registration process begins by filling a registration form. This form allows the administrator to enroll users by entering their personal information and then, by starting the extraction process of their facial features which will configure the users  face pattern. The enrollment can be done with a username, ID number, pin number or card. In every case, the registry is done the same way. The only difference is when a user registers with a card, because it is necessary to first insert the card where the ID of that user is saved. Verification The verification / authentication process consists in comparing (1:1) the biometric features of two entities. The system verifies whether a user actually is who he/she claims to be. In order to do so, the system needs to know the identity of the user prior to the authentication process. There are two ways of introducing the user ID: through a card or typing manually the ID numbers, pin or name. Identification The identification process consists of carrying out a comparison (1:N) of biometric features. The system determines the identity of the user. For it, the extracted face pattern is compared against the systems  database of registered users. If the comparison result is correct, the system will highlight the user whose pattern, stored in the database, matches the most to the pattern obtained in the extraction process. +10 MUSERS +850 MAUTHENTICATIONS +40 CLIENTS.

CERTIFIED LIVENESS DETECTION IN 2 SECONDS. WORKS IN REAL-WORLD LIGHTING CONDITIONS. GREAT WITH GLASSES, MAKEUP & BEARDS. Certified Liveness + 3D Face Matching. SECURITY CERTIFIED  1 IN THE WORLD. Can a Selfie Really Provide Security? Obviously selfies are easy to take; the real question is if they can provide effective access security. Typically they can t, but ZoOm s patented process isn t just a selfie; it s a face scan that provides a 3D FaceMap and a Certified Liveness Check to ensure the user is physically present, and prevent masks, dolls, photos, or video deepfakes from fooling the system. The Liveness Detection algorithms must observe so many concurrent human traits that spoof artifacts can t recreate them all at once.  ZoOm s 3D Face Matching then compares the user to their previously-enrolled 3D FaceMap, and if the two FaceMaps highly match (1/4.2M+ FAR), the verified user is granted access. No Liveness Data = No Honeypot Risk Two types of data are required for every face authentication: Face Data (for matching) and Liveness Data (to prove the Face Data was collected from a live person).  Liveness Data must be timestamped, be valid only for a few minutes, and then deleted.  New Liveness Data must be collected for every authentication attempt. Face photos are just ""Face Data"" without any corresponding Liveness Data, so they cannot be used to spoof Certified Liveness Detection, and thus, storing photos does not create honeypot risk.  Think of the stored Face Data as the lock, the User s newly collected Face Data as a One-Time-Use key, and the Liveness Data as proof that key has never been used in the lock before. ZoOm s Encrypted 3D FaceMaps: Can t Be Phished From Users Aren t a Biometric Honeypot Stop Credential Sharing Stop Botnet Attacks Match 1:1 & 1:N at a 1/4.2M FAR Match Highly to a Photo ID Provide Anonymous Age Estimates. HOW ZoOm WORKS: During the ZoOm motion, the camera s view of the 3D face changes, observing perspective distortion and proving it is 3D. In under 2 seconds, ZoOm processes 30+ video frames and reverse engineers a 3D FaceMap from the standard 2D camera. CERTIFIED LIVENESS DETECTION: Over the last five years, we dove more deeply into anti-spoofing than anyone ‚Äì ever.  We have performed hundreds-of-millions of spoof attempts with every conceivable type of media and learned how to stop them. Attack Vectors include: 2D paper photos & digital images High resolution videos Image swap-in after liveness check Paper masks with eye & mouth cutouts Hollywood masks, wax figures & lifelike dolls Photos or video frames animated into avatars Video projections on 3D heads Sleeping users with closed eyes Impostors, lookalikes & doppelgangers. Passing the rigorous iBeta Level 1 & 2 tests prove ZoOm is an unsharable, unphishable biometric that is virtually impossible for criminals to spoof using today s media technology. BIOMETRIC BEST PRACTICES: Demand Certified 3D Liveness Detection.  Without it, you cannot trust unsupervised authentications and will be put at risk by ""Suprema"" type biometric data breaches.  With Certified Liveness, data breaches can t be leveraged against your users. Delete Liveness Data after each login and collect new Liveness Data for every new session.  This prevents biometric honeypots and allows for safe, centralized biometric storage. Centralized Biometric storage with Server-Side 3D Face Matching is the only way to truly replace passwords, enable cross-platform logins, simplify device upgrades, and allow multiple devices/users. Choose a diverse algorithm.  Don t be accused of having a ""biased"" biometric just because the training sets used to create it were too homogeneous.  ZoOm trained with users from over 170 countries. Certified Liveness + 3D Face Matching. 2D Face Recognition will never provide the accuracy needed for Face Authentication.  There is too much variability and overlapping similarity in human faces to achieve a high enough FAR (False Accept Rate) when they are flattened from 3D to 2D.

CORPORATE BACKGROUND. Filmetrics Corporation was incorporated in 2009, and has since forged a name of its own as a Philippine-based technology-driven enterprise providing premier identity management solutions, best practice insights and business intelligence to different organizations nationwide. Filmetrics serves as the Information Technology branch in the Freyfil Group of Companies. Its sister companies specialize on Construction, Geodetic Investigation, Mining and Aggregates, Engineering Consulting, Surveying and Mapping, Maritime Transportation and Real Estate. In September 2009, it entered into a joint venture with the Philippine Postal Corporation (PHLPost) to create a biometric data service facility that eventually paved the way for the partnership to provide a biometric identification and registration system to the Philippine s largest pension and retirement fund, the Social Security System. In 2010, this collaborative effort with SSS yielded a home-grown and cost effective, fully outsourced biometric enrollment service module that enabled SSS to become the first fully compliant government financial institution under the Unified Membership Identification (UMID) standards set by the Philippine government. Another milestone for the company is the five-year extension of the service contract to 2020, a testament to how Filmetrics is able to consistently deliver exceptional service and satisfy its clients  demands and expectations. In its vision to establish safe and secure digital bridges for everyone, Filmetrics, together with PHLPost, also launched in November 2014 a more secure and verifiable Postal ID card that gave millions of Filipinos better access to a government-issued ID that does not require any special skills, employment or professional license.

CSR at Fujitsu: Since the Industrial Revolution, technological advances and the trend toward globalization have led to astounding progress in society. This sudden growth, however, has also triggered global warming and rapid urbanization and created numerous social distortions, such as widening inequality. Turning to the digital society, new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G are bringing unprecedented convenience to our daily lives and to businesses. On the other hand, new challenges such as privacy, security and reduced employment are emerging.‚Ä¶ Global Responsible Business Given the requirement to enhance sustainability-focused corporate management, fulfilling corporate social responsibility from a global perspective has become an increasingly important issue. The Fujitsu Group promotes its CSR activities based on the CSR Policy. In order to strive for global effectiveness, we have reviewed material issues across the Group based on materiality analysis, and have established a framework called ""Global Responsible Business"" by classifying issues into the following eight areas. Socio-Economic ICT Impact, Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, Wellbeing, Environment, Compliance, Supply Chain, Health and Safety, Community. Corporate Governance, Risk Management, Information Security, Quality and Customer Satisfaction. FUJITSU BIOMETRICS: Open Biometric technologies confirm an individual s personal identity. One-of-a-kind information, such as iris and palm-vein patterns and fingerprints, are extremely hard to duplicate ‚Äì and more secure. One-of-a-kind information, such as iris and palm-vein patterns and fingerprints, are extremely hard to duplicate ‚Äì and more secure. Define the right biometrics for your business As an enterprise organization, you still need to carefully consider your particular information security needs, and protect them from unwanted parties with relevant biometric identity management that brings together extreme ease of use and security across your enterprise. Fujitsu helps in selecting the best-suited biometric technology for your particular budget, environment, requirements and other criteria, for optimal results. As a leading provider and supplier of biometric authentication technology, Fujitsu has the expertise and insight to ensure your biometric authentication matches your business requirements. Effective biometrics should be: Permanent - and unchanged during an individual s lifetime Universal - based on a pre-defined, available technology Easy to collect - and use Safe - using validated methods specified by ISO standards Unaffected by outside environmental influences - such as light quality or weather Affordable. Fujitsu PalmSecure Palm Vein Authentication Technology. Biometrics as a Service. High Safety - palm vein is an internal biometric, therefore difficult to defeat compared to other external body biometrics such as fingerprint, face and iris. High Accuracy - it has a false acceptance rate under 0.00001% when the false rejection rate is 0.01% (with 1 retry) which makes it one of the most accurate biometric authentication system currently available in the market. High Acceptance - Contactless easy and hygiene operation with virtually 0% fail to enroll rate. Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì The Next Wave in Digitalization Today, a powerful new digital technology is emerging - Artificial Intelligence (AI). Previous waves of digitalization have delivered ubiquitous broadband, internet access for billions of people worldwide, mobile connectivity, and the Internet of Things (IoT) which has opened the door to a wealth of data and information. Now, by creating a real-time dialogue between people, things and information, we are entering a hyperconnected era where AI can be applied in real, everyday business situations. The world will never be the same again. In many cases, from handwriting recognition to passing mathematics exams, AI has already proven more accurate than human experts. However, that s not to say humans will be replaced by machines. With machines able to tackle more and more mundane tasks, workers will be enabled to focus on areas that add more value. Artificial Intelligence and Fujitsu At Fujitsu, people remain central to our vision, with AI solutions centered firmly on empowering workers and citizens, creating value and supporting the work they do. The impact of AI on our lives may not be something that we will notice or appreciate overnight, however, one thing is clear - its progress is constant and inevitable. It s only when we step back that we see how far we ve already come, and appreciate the journey that s still ahead. Fujitsu Zinrai brings together diverse AI techniques and development threads. Zinrai itself is neither a service nor a product, but a collective framework for the broad family of AI capabilities that are available to Fujitsu customers. Zinrai AI provides a human-centric approach to the co-creation of services and solutions.

Transforming your industry with AI In the business world, AI is radically transforming many industries. With its ability to identify patterns and detect anomalies in mountains of digital information it s adding a new dimension, and once trained, it s tireless in processing many standard tasks. For example ‚Äì by adding AI to service desks and call centers, staff are freed from performing low-level, monotonous tasks, and are enabled to focus on addressing more complex technical problems/complicated requests, or delivering an enhanced customer experience/improved customer care. Here are just examples... Utilities Network Optimization Cyber attacks detection Transport Self-driving Traffic intelligence Logistics Vehicle routing Car dispatching Finance Consumer engagement Regulation and Security Manufacturing Equipment failure prediction Quality Control Healthcare Diagnosis support Drug discovery assist Retail Customer Flow Analysis Demand Forecasting Public Sector City Monitoring Citizen Services. AI in Financial Services One of the true strengths of AI is in the field of pattern recognition and analysis. Today, financial institutions are using artificial intelligence to model the potential direction of stock markets. AI is also extending the capabilities of analytics platforms - for instance, at Fujitsu, we have undertaken a proof of concept to analyze signatures to help detect fraudulent patterns. In addition, we ve also been talking to banks about the use of facial recognition in ATMs - not only to improve security but also to personalize services. Fujitsu Develops AI based Facial Expression Recognition Technology to Accurately Detect Subtle Changes in Expression. Fujitsu Develops Non-contact Biometric Integration Technology as an Optimal Solution for a Cashless Society. Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. today announces development of a non-contact, integrated biometric authentication technology that can identify a person using only their palm vein and facial data. Developed jointly with Fujitsu R&D Center Co., Ltd., the technology represents a step closer to the creation of a cashless society. Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd. and Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Inc. today announced the development of an AI facial expression recognition technology that detects subtle changes in facial expression with a high degree of accuracy. The new technology was developed in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. Fujitsu AI to Smooth Robot and Human Communication.

Going forward, Fujitsu plans to successively roll out services, such as the Robot AI Platform Basic Service for Multiple Devices, which can connect to various front-end devices, including tablets, smartphones, and intercoms. This platform offers communication technologies such as natural language conversation, facial expression recognition, voice-emotion analysis, and face recognition, as cloud services that can connect with devices such as robots. Robots connected to this platform can provide communication services via natural conversation suited to the situation and interests of individuals in a variety of settings, including customer service and elder care. By connecting this platform to existing customer systems, customers can add additional value from the use of robots to their work processes and services. Fujitsu Begins Sales of City Monitoring and Parking Management Solutions that Employ AI Technology. Fujitsu today announced development of solutions that make use of images from surveillance cameras deployed throughout a city or inside a facility, using high-speed image processing technology cultivated with its Human Centric AI Zinrai artificial intelligence and supercomputer technologies. FUJITSU Technical Computing Solution GREENAGES Citywide Surveillance software, which enables a real-time understanding of urban conditions, and FUJITSU Technical Computing Solution GREENAGES Parking Analysis software for intelligent parking management, will be available for sale in Japan from today. Using image analysis that employs advanced AI technology, Citywide Surveillance automatically extracts a variety of data from surveillance camera images, such as the type or make of vehicles, or the type of clothing someone is wearing, giving users a real-time understanding of movements throughout an urban environment. For customers with monitoring needs beyond vehicles or people, Fujitsu s AI experts will provide AI learning services with expanded image analysis capabilities, built on highly accurate recognition models. Parking Analysis supports improved management efficiency of parking lots or garages by ascertaining which parking spots are open or monitoring no-parking zones in real time.

Introduction We have been developing the technology for more than 10 years as a specialized face recognition company. We continue to research on face recognition research for a long time, and the technology performance of the algorithm is at the top level in the world. And we have a wide range of products such as access control, CCTV security surveillance, legal, finance, entertainment, automobile industry, We are supplying application products to the field. We began research on 2D facial recognition in mid-2006, succeeded in developing a commercial face recognition engine in 2011, and launched face recognition products. In 2016, the development of algorithms with dramatically improved recognition performance was completed, The recognition rate has reached the highest level in the world. HBFacePro Face Recognition Technology was recognized as the best technology in Korean Face Recognition Performance Evaluation by Korea Internet Promotion Agency (KISA) and the second highest recognition accuracy in FIVE (Face In Video Evaluation), a global evaluation test of NIST Achieved the   1 speed performance. In addition, the company s research team has also conducted research on gender and age recognition of facial images and released related products. Since 2015, 3D face recognition has been studied and biomechanical analysis of facial features has been under way. Now, based on the R&D achievements for deep learning, we are improving the recognition rate and improving the processing speed remarkably. For the first time in Korea, we have been continuously participated and certified in the global evaluation test conducted by NIST. In addition, for the first time in Korea, we have filed a number of PCT patents related to personal authentication technology, which combines facial recognition technology, to prepare for entry into the global market. Based on this, we have developed a face recognition solution that can interoperate with the member company of FIDO (Fast Identification Online Alliance), the international standard consortium of the certified authentication solution and the security SD card for the first time in the world. The company is also actively seeking to enter the global market through partnerships with partners around the world, such as a suspect search system, as well as affiliates with Aventura Technology, a US developer of integrated control system. Features Of HBFacePro Fast & Accurate face detection technology High-speed / high-precision detection is possible even on the face not facing the front. It has the fastest face detection technology among existing commercialized face recognition products with face detection speed of 18 ~ 20 faces / s when image resolution is 640 x 480. Using the learning algorithm that optimally tunes the frontal face pattern and the non-frontal face pattern, it is possible to detect up to 45 degrees in the yaw direction and 20 degrees in the forward and backward directions of the face. It is possible to accurately detect facial feature points including eyes, nose, and mouth even in images with low resolution and noise. Face recognition technology robust to various environmental conditions Generally, in the case of the third-party algorithm, recognition accuracy is relatively high for a regular face image such as FERET, but the accuracy is low for an irregular face image captured in a situation close to a real environment. HBFacePro face recognition technology is superior to images taken in each application environment. The recognition result mentioned below shows that the authentication is successful when the similarity degree 0.5 corresponding to the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.5 is set as the threshold and the two faces are compared. - Recognition is possible even if part of the face is covered because recognition is performed by paying attention to important face parts. - It has a strong resistance to environmental factors, including rotation, changes in illumination of the face. - Recognition is possible even when wearing glasses and accessories. - Sketch images such as low-resolution images and illustrations can also be recognized, which can be useful for searching for passports and driver s licenses, searching for suspects in legal investigations, etc. Advantages Over Others Comparison with Luxand Face Recognition Technology Luxand is an American face recognition company founded in 2005. Luxand have developed a technology that can perform fully automatic face recognition, starting with research on artificial intelligence and biometrics technology. Recently, we have been providing face recognition solutions while focusing on online entertainment business. Verification performance of HBFacePro algorithm and Luxand algorithm based on multi - ethnic Mugshot photo database is as follows. Comparison with NEC Face Recognition Technology The face recognition technology developed by NEC Corporation s central technology research institute was evaluated by NIST FRVT 2013 under the supervision of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the same way as in Luxand, NEC s face recognition algorithm and HBFacePro s verification performance were compared with NEC, which proved to be the world s highest level of face recognition technology. Algorithm Overview The HBFacePro face recognition algorithm consists of Face Detection, Landmarks Detection, Normalization and Preprocessing, Face Template Generation, and Comparison. Face Detection Face detection is the process of detecting the position and size of a face in a given input image. HBFacePro uses ADaboost with Composite Patterns (ACP) based on Adaboost machine learning algorithm and developed by its independent technology. It has robust characteristics against face rotation and illumination condition. 1) Creating an image pyramid Converts an input image to a monochrome image, and generates an image pyramid composed of element images of various scales. 2) Face Search For each image on the image pyramid, the template pattern is moved relative to the entire area of the image, and the image area on the template is extracted and input to the face detector to determine whether the face is a face. The face detector is a parallel multi-stage detector (Parallel Cascaded Detector) which is learned by using a template pattern that combines a symmetric pattern structure and an asymmetric pattern structure. 3) After the face search for all the images of the image pyramid is completed, the final detection result is calculated by combining the plurality of face detection information detected for the image pyramid. Landmarks Detection Landmark refers to the main points of the face such as eyes, nose, and mouth. HBFacePro utilizes ASM + FG (Active Shape Model and Face Graph) technology developed by its own research and development team and has 23 detectable face feature points. Normalization And Preprocessing In the normalization step, the facial part is separately extracted from the input image based on the positions of the detected facial feature points, and then normalization is performed by a rotation transformation to directly set the inclined face and a scale transformation to convert the image into a constant size image Thereby generating a face image. In the KH-SF-5 algorithm employed in HBFacePro 5.x version, the face image is normalized using face warping based face reshaping algorithm. Face Template Generation & Comparison In order to generate a face template, the face is divided into a number of cell regions by dividing the face into grids having a predetermined interval, and a frequency region-based feature extraction transformation is applied within each cell region to reflect unique characteristics in the cell region a local feature vector is extracted. The local feature vectors extracted for each part of the face are fused into a global feature vector reflecting the unique characteristics of the whole face. In order to reduce memory usage and file storage space during registration, a face template is generated by compressing facial feature vectors using an encoding algorithm. During enrollment, the face template is stored as a binary file with the registration ID or name, and the similarity between the registered face template (Gallery Template) and the input template (Probe Template) And if the similarity is equal to or greater than predetermined threshold value, it is determined that the person is the person.

FIND THE BEST TALENT FASTER WITH AI-DRIVEN PREDICTIONS. CONSIDER MORE APPLICANTS DRIVE CONSISTENCY REDUCE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS BETTER DECISION MAKING. BIAS, AI ETHICS & THE HIREVUE APPROACH. HireVue recognizes the impact that our software can have on individuals and on society, and we act upon this responsibility with deep commitment. The following principles guide our thoughts and actions as we develop artificial intelligence (AI) technology and incorporate it into our products and technologies. All of us now live in a rapidly shifting technology landscape in which change is constant. Because of this, HireVue practices will continue to evolve as we work with our customers, job-seekers, technology partners, ethicists, legal advisors, and society at large to ensure we are always holding ourselves to the highest possible standards. HIREVUE AI ETHICAL PRINCIPLES 1. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BENEFITTING SOCIETY We recognize that our software impacts individuals, companies and potentially our society at large and we are committed to understanding that impact and being thoughtful in all of our actions to do the greatest good. Our goal is to build systems that augment and improve human decision-making. We are focused on helping our customers find the best people to work for their companies as well as helping them grow and develop those people after hire. 2. WE DESIGN TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND FAIRNESS Because HireVue uses AI technology in our products, we actively work to prevent the introduction or propagation of bias against any group or individual. We will continue to carefully review the datasets we use in our work and ensure that they are as accurate and diverse as possible. We also continue to advance our abilities to monitor, detect, and mitigate bias. We strive to build teams from diverse backgrounds with diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to best represent the people our systems serve. 3. WE DESIGN TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE BETTER DECISIONS Our goal is to develop solutions that combine the strengths of machines and people together to improve decision-making. Our systems are designed to consume complex data to augment and improve human decision-making. We carefully design our products to provide clear understanding about what is being predicted, the confidence in the prediction and appropriate explanation of the data. We also provide feedback mechanisms that allow human input to build trust and improve overall functioning of our systems. 4. WE DESIGN FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION We are committed to incorporating privacy of data at each step of our process of technology development and deployment. We will give opportunity for notice and consent, encourage architectures on a foundation of privacy safeguards, and provide appropriate transparency and control over the use of data consistent with best practices and legal standards. 5. WE VALIDATE AND TEST CONTINUOUSLY All of HireVue s algorithms are tested prior to use to validate that they both do what they are intended to do and that their results generate unbiased outputs. Ongoing monitoring is performed to the fullest extent possible to ensure that real-world behavior matches the expected behavior. In 1978, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Process were jointly adopted by the U.S. Civil Service Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to provide a uniform set of principles to help govern the appropriate use of employee selection procedures and employment-related decisions. Consistent with the guidelines, our mission is not just to avoid bias in the inferences and employment decisions made based on our technology, but to use the technology to actively promote diversity and aid in the achievement of equal opportunity for everyone regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or disability status. Hirevue s data scientists work alongside a team of industrial-organizational (IO) psychologists with decades of assessment and adverse-impact testing experience. Consistent with generally accepted legal, professional and validation standards established within the field of psychology, our data scientists and IO psychologists continuously evaluate the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations and employment decisions made based on assessment results, while ensuring protected groups are not adversely impacted. HireVue has accumulated a significant and growing body of validity evidence to provide a sound scientific basis for the use of our assessments to aide with job-related decisions that minimize the potential for adverse impact. Our data scientists and IO psychologists build HireVue Assessment algorithms in a way that removes data from consideration by the algorithm that contributes to adverse impact without significantly impacting the assessment s predictive accuracy. The result is a highly valid, bias-mitigated assessment that helps to enhance human decision making while actively promoting diversity and equal opportunity regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or disability status.",https://www.hirevue.com/,2390,2.00E+13,2.03E+13

Humaniq Care is a charity and fundraising platform built around our application and infrastructure. The first mobile service with the capacity to change the world. Humaniq is a new generation financial services with its own cryptocurrency, which is aimed at eradicating poverty amongst millions of people living in the emerging economies. For the unbanked people: Humaniq opens up the benefits of financial inclusion and grants access to a series of financial services. For businesses: Humaniq enables start-ups and projects to offer their services to an audience of billions. According to the World Bank s Global Financial Inclusion Database, there are currently 1.7 billion people on Earth who do not have access to official financial services. Humaniq s ever‚Äëgrowing userbase is a blue ocean for thousands of new projects. 1 billion new users in the coming years. $4 trillion potentially in user accounts. 200+ start-ups are planning to move onto the Humaniq platform. What makes Humaniq a big thing. Connecting the unbanked: 10 years of research across Asia and Africa, carried out by the authors of Portfolios of the Poor, showed that poverty proliferates in regions whose inhabitants do not have access to financial services. Humaniq is becoming the simplest route to financial inclusion for billions of people. User base exponential growth: According to Metcalfe s law, the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. For Humaniq, this means that the more unbanked people who join the system, the greater the motivation will be for other people to join. Join the global Humaniq community. Simplicity and safety for the unbanked. Biometric authentification: Users are verified by their face and voice, eliminating the need for formal documentation. Independent HMQ currency: Every new user receives $20 worth of HMQ in their account, the value of which bears no relation to their local currency. The interface is simple to interact with: Even for those who have never used gadgets before. Extraordinary opportunitites for business. Based on Ethereum blockchain protocol: Guaranteed security against hacking, corruption and loss of information thanks to complete decentralisation. Independent fund and accelerator: External projects and promising ideas can receive expert support and investment for a launch into the Humaniq system. Open API: Any project can merge into the Humaniq system. The world is ready for change. ""Including the poorest in the financial system increases the value of their assets, transforming the underlying economics of financial services through digital currency - helping those who live in poverty directly."" - Bill Gates. Humaniq use cases. Zero fee money transfers: Blockchain technology allows users to carry out direct money transfers, cutting out the middleman. The money is transferred as our HMQ cryptocurrency and withdrawn via authorised exchange points. Users can choose the point with the best exchange rate, therefore avoiding any financial monopolies. Remote work: Companies can utilise Humaniq s ever-growing user base to carry out tasks involving the processing of information. Users can decode and translate texts, identify photographs, locate geotags and so on, in return for renumeration. Charity without corruption: Charity, carried out in the traditional way, often leads to a large proportion of donated money falling into the wrong hands. Blockchain technology, combined with the infrastructure of Humaniq, ensures that donations are completely transparent: stakeholders are able to see what every penny is spent on and can be sure that all of their money is going to help people. Guarantor lending: Grameen Bank in Bangladesh has created a system of loans based on honesty and trust, which guarantees over 90% repayment. The Humaniq system allows for the creation of a similar system but on a global scale: every person on Earth will be able to take out a commission-free loan using nothing but a smartphone and the Humaniq app. Direct lending to entrepreneurs: Following the principle of the non-profit organisation Kiva Microfunds, which enables loans for entrepreneurs on low incomes, Humaniq will become a platform for both donations and loans. You can lend money to a business you d like to support, either as a grant or with the expectation of a return ‚Äì the blockchain technology makes this process incredibly simple and effective for both parties. Humaniq global challenge. Life-changing technology: Humaniq grew out of the idea that advanced technologies should benefit everybody. Now, we want to inspire developers from all over the world to come and join our movement. Humanitarian impact: Humaniq is not just a commercial project. It is a worldwide mission, aiming to give people in developing nations more power to change their lives.",https://humaniq.com/,656,2.00E+13,2.03E+13

Since the launch of the Visual Recognition API this past May, we ve seen users help California save water, perform infrastructure inspections with drones, and even find Pokemon. Powering many of these use cases are custom classifiers, a feature within Visual Recognition that allows users to train Watson on almost any visual content. Custom classifiers can be highly powerful but require careful training and content considerations to be properly optimized. Through our user conversations, we ve assembled a best practices guide below to help you get the most out of your custom classifiers. Examples of difficult use cases While Watson Visual Recognition is highly flexible, there have been a number of recurring use case that we ve seen the API either struggle on or require significant pre/post-work from the user. Face Recognition: Visual Recognition is capable of face detection (detecting the presence of faces) not face recognition (identifying individuals). Detecting details: Occasionally, users want to classify an image based on a small section of an image or details scattered within an image. Because Watson analyzes the entire image when training, it may struggle on classifications that depend on small details. Some users have adopted the strategy of breaking the image into pieces or zooming into relevant parts of an image. See this hail classification use case as an example (video). Emotion: Emotion classification (whether facial emotion or contextual emotion) is not a feature currently supported by Visual Recognition. Some users have attempted to do this through custom classifiers, but this is an edge case and we cannot estimate the accuracy of this type of training. Watson Visual Recognition: Quickly and accurately tag, classify and search visual content using machine learning. What is Watson Visual Recognition? Watson Visual Recognition makes it easy to extract thousands of labels from your organization s images and detect for specific content out-of-the-box. You can also build custom models to detect for specific content in images inside your applications. Overview Classify your images Understand an image s content out-of-the-box. Our pre-trained models enable you to analyze images for objects, colors, food, explicit content and other subjects for insights into your visual content. Train with less data Build a custom model with less training data and still achieve high accuracy. Object Detection Train a model to locate, count and understand relative size of multiple different objects. Why Watson for Visual Recognition? Easy Custom Training Quickly label images and train a model with Watson Studio s easy to use training experience. Visually Inspect Anything With a few images, train a computer vision model to detect damage on cars or parts of a circuit board using Watson Studio ‚Äî a free workspace where you can create, test, and manage your custom models. Bring AI into iOS apps with Core ML With Watson Visual Recognition for Core ML, you can build computer vision mobile apps with no downtime. Get started with Watson Studio to build, test, and deploy your own custom models to iOS. Autoglass¬Æ BodyRepair Belron brand Autoglass¬Æ BodyRepair applied Watson Visual Recognition to its website s booking page, which visually analyzes customer photos of vehicle damage and automatically recommends a repair price. The result is a 70% improvement in quote processing times by using AI analyses to determine repair costs. Coca Cola + IBM Field technicians used Watson Visual Recognition with Core ML to diagnose and correct problems on-site with little or no network connectivity. With the AI capabilities of Watson Visual Recognition and Core ML, relevant information is put directly into a tech s hands the moment they need it, to resolve issues quickly and efficiently. Pulsar With Watson Visual Recognition, Pulsar can look beyond image captions for a more in-depth understanding of the way audiences interpret and respond to imagery.

Today, with a few swipes, taps or clicks on your smartphone, you can prove your identity, make a money transfer, sign a banking contract, order a ride, go shopping and dine out with friends. The trust of consumers is the basis for any form of transaction. But how can we ensure this effortless swiping doesn t fall into the wrong hands? 1,800 financial institutions (including most of the world s largest banks) trust us + 2M cards digitalized per month in the 3 major digital wallets  1 mastering the largest biometric acquisition and verification projects in the world. Studying the world around us While designing IDEMIA s solutions, we tapped into our own curiosity and looked all around us for sources of inspiration. We observed that today s financial institutions are undergoing a massive transformation from retail to digital banking and seeking out multichannel strategies to protect client relationships. To meet their needs, IDEMIA has given birth to offers that help financial institutions take on mobility and digitalization, shaping the future banking and payment customer journey.

With a tap on our smartphone or a fingerprint scan, we can prove our identities, open a bank account, define our PIN code, add our banking card to a new mobile wallet or make a payment. IDEMIA promises to ensure that all this effortless swiping never falls into the wrong hands. Biometrics for identification and authentication: We promise that ironclad security will never come at the expense of user convenience. The scene is all too familiar: you want to check your account balance on your banking app, or purchase something at your favorite boutique, only you forgot your PIN code or you re struggling with your login. At IDEMIA, we have innovated and tirelessly developed solutions that enable financial institutions to rely on trusted identities, verified by 100% reliable biometrics ‚Äì whether a quick smartphone selfie or a fingerprint scan on your bank card. Rest easy, your identity is in good hands. Adaptive Authentication: Authentication occurs each time users wish to access a service, perform a transaction, sign a contract or make a payment. It is the process of determining if they are whom they claim to be. When defining an authentication strategy, financial institutions need an approach that lets them easily address a complex and dynamic reality. They need to authenticate multiple customers  profiles for a wide range of use cases with different levels of risk. With IDEMIA s DACS‚Ñ¢* software platform they can adopt a global, adaptable approach to strong authentication. Following a Transaction Risk Analysis, end-users are prompted to authenticate with the best-suited authentication method, chosen among a wide range of factors (mobile, biometrics, SMS OTP, certificates, passwords‚Ä¶), according to their authentication policy. IDEMIA also offers an innovative authentication method, CloudCard+‚Ñ¢, relying on up to three authentication factors: the smartphone (possession), biometrics (inherence), and PIN (knowledge). Our solutions are compliant with the European Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) requirements for Strong Customer Authentication. Biometric Enrollment: Biometric innovations have been cropping up all around us and simplifying our lives. Instead of tapping in (and remembering!) a PIN code, we now unlock our mobile phones with a quick and simple scan of our fingerprint, face or iris. The arrival of biometric cards is finally hitting the banking industry. This major innovation is profoundly changing the card user experience. As they do with their smartphone, users can now replace card PIN codes with their fingerprint. In order to maintain the same stringent level of security with these innovative cards, securing the biometric data enrollment process is vital. IDEMIA s Biometric Enrollment Services offer two ironclad ways to capture and register user data: in-branch or from the comfort of home. Using a specialized tablet, developed by IDEMIA, banks can capture customers  biometric data and store information directly in the payment card itself. Cardholders may also use their smartphones to capture their biometric data and follow step-by-step instructions to securely store this data in their card from home. MorphoTablet 2i: Harnessing the power of 3 biometrics for mobile enrollment, authentication and identification. Biometrics are by far the most convenient and reliable means to identify and authenticate people. For law enforcement, border control, civil enrolment and elections, or firms that want to check employee/visitor IDs, the use of MorphoTablet‚Ñ¢ for fingerprint and facial recognition has already proved invaluable. Today, IDEMIA has taken that solution to a new level. MorphoTablet‚Ñ¢ 2i by IDEMIA enables improved universality and security by including all three biometrics in one mobile terminal: fingerprint, facial, and now iris. In civil society, for example, MorphoTablet‚Ñ¢ 2i can help authorities to securely enrol population onto a government program, ensure that they only vote once in an election or authenticate citizens for the renewal of their ID documents. To comply with KYC requirements in sectors such as financial services or mobile telecommunications, it can deliver rapid, digital onboarding of new customers.

The following discussion examines the significance of individual identification documents as well as propose security advancements that work to keep your identity safe in a rapidly changing world. Facial recognition: A strategic imperative for national security. AUTOMATION, INNOVATION, AND PRIVACY: VIDEO INVESTIGATION AND ITS ROLE IN PUBLIC SAFETY Over the past several years, the massive growth and innovation seen in the public safety and security industries has perhaps been overshadowed by a substantial pushback from privacy advocates who see these developments as moving us closer to a police state. Other markets, such as home automation, are forced to address similar concerns without the obligation to put the public interest first. This evolution coincides with an explosion in the availability of raw data, fueled by the rapid drop in cost of underlying security technologies such as cameras. FACE RECOGNITION ‚Äì A CRITICAL TOOL IF DEPLOYED RESPONSIBLY Recently, San Francisco became the first major American city to ban local government agencies  use of Face Recognition technology (FRT). Overall anti-police sentiment has contributed to a dozen U.S. cities passing similar laws, with 20 or so others weighing similar legislation. While most consumers have willingly sacrificed digital privacy in exchange for convenience, many are staunchly opposed to any attempts by law enforcement agencies to use biometrics. While it would be dismissive to say that these concerns are unfounded, bad actors may use public pushback on FRT to their advantage. FORENSIC FACE COMPARISON TRAINING.

Our patent-pending technology creates new possibilities while upholding privacy and our human rights. Indivd uses image data to create valuable insights like re-visits without processing biometric data or storing personal data. Privacypodden audits Indivd s unique technology. Indvid applies for new patents and expand the patent portfolio. Transforming store data into a proactive retail experience. The pressure is very high on the retail industry when the society transforms from analogue to digital. In this major upheaval, increased customer insights are vital for the industry if it s going to be able to strengthen its relevance, be more effective and survive. A status quo which might be changed with the help of Indivd. We offer retailers a unique insight into all their store visitors interest, behaviors. Our unique technology is able to re-identify all visitors over time and place. From one day to another and from one location to another location in another city or country. Data we can use to create insights like revisit frequency, bounce rate, conversion queue statistics, visitor profiles and about 100 more. Privacy-driven technology development. Face it! Indivd is founded on an idea of privacy-driven technology where human rights are at the core of the development. Because the commercial and political interests to use non-democratic technologies to control and monitor our lives is a threat to democratic societies. Legislation like GDPR is an important tool to manage our rights but that s not enough. The development and integration of non-democratic technologies are already taking place. Facial recognition is a no-go-zone and we say no to facial recognition based on UN s 12th article, The right to privacy. You don t need to surveil ‚Äì and in the long-run control ‚Äì to better understand us humans. We strive to prove that there are better technologies for this that help us to promote ‚Äì and not counter ‚Äì privacy. We achieve this by: Privacy innovations Creating privacy-innovations that raise the overall privacy in society, Work for better awareness Participating in debates and work for better awareness of the big privacy issues, Supporting Supporting and funding good privacy-initiatives. Indivd is founded by an international mix of serial entrepreneurs, developers, and leading AI Scientists. Some of us has built one of the fastest growing SaaS companies in Sweden while others are experts in neural networks, reinforcement learning and has worked on an effort to create a full-scale simulation of the learning human brain. How can you claim that Indivd is legal? We cannot claim to be legal since this is a question for legal experts and the authorities. We have followed the procedures of GDPR which says that we are supposed to do a balance test (DPIA) with legal experts. A test where the legal expert claimed that Indivd is legal. How can you be so sure of that the technology is GDPR compliant? Indivd is built as an alternative technology, which does not process biometric data or store personal data. Our anonymized facial recognition has a clear equivalence with best practices within the research dataset and the guidelines developed by Eurostat. We use much higher anonymity criteria than publicly released anonymized medical data and similar sensitive data and our technology is audited by several legal experts which claims that Indivd is legal. The legality is partly because we do not process biometric data, do not save personal data, solve major challenges for physical retail stores and are less intrusive than the techniques / methods currently used in the stores. Indivd at Nordic Privacy Arena ""We have eliminated the huge risks of facial recognition."" Transparency and privacy important core values for Indivd. As part of this ambitious and serious preparatory work, we have also decided, before submitting the application to The Swedish Data Protection Authority, to allow Privacypooden¬¥s data protection experts to carry out a tough corresponding audit. ""Facial recognition technology is mature, accurate, only takes half a day to set up, and it can already deliver good statistics today,"" says Fredrik Hammarg√•rden, Head of Commercialization at Indivd, in an interview in the podcast Effekten, where the problems with the new technology are discussed.",https://www.indivd.com/,105,2.02E+13,2.03E+13

Explore our Plug & Play Facial Recognition. AI - Powered OCR & Facial Authentication Digital Onboarding Toolkit. Innovatrics ABIS Biometrics, tailored. NIST FRVT: Innovatrics Face Recognition Technology Confirmed as Top Performer. About Innovatrics: We are an independent, trusted partner for biometric identity management technology. To date, we have successfully completed over 500 projects in 80 countries and over a billion people have been biometrically processed using Innovatrics software. TOP RANKED TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIVE APPROACH PROACTIVE CUSTOMER CARE SMART SOLUTION. Our technology advantages. Blazing Performance: Industry-leading matching speed. Speed is in our DNA. Our fingerprint matching algorithm is now the fastest in the world with a matching speed of 1.04 billion per second on a standard server. Continuous innovation has helped us achieve this blazing performance, ensuring that we have stayed ahead of our competitors and that our unique algorithm continues to underpin the fastest AFIS solution available on the market. We are not just leading innovators in the area of fingerprint biometrics; our facial recognition technology is also a top performer. Continuous development of our algorithm, combined with innovations such as newly introduced GPU acceleration support means our facial technology is now capable of performing thousands of facial template extractions per second. As well as underpinning our fingerprint and face technologies, our culture of innovation and passion for challenges drives our research and development in other biometric modalities. Where speed matters? Matching speed is a key factor for large-scale projects with multiple millions of enrollees. A high-performance algorithm means less servers are required to support the solution, while maintaining high throughput and very low latency. This results in greatly reduced response times, real-time identification and significant cost savings, especially when we consider very large systems with more than 100 million enrollees. Stunning Accuracy: Top accuracy in NIST PFT II, Top Ranked in FpVTE, Top Ranked in FRVT. Speed is important, but accuracy is critical. We don t compromise. Without accuracy, speed is irrelevant. From the very beginning, our algorithm has delivered stunning accuracy to our solutions. The founders of Innovatrics  first mission was to fix biometrics and to make biometric technology practical and reliable. By focusing on quality, investing in the smartest people and exploring new areas of deep learning, we ve managed to achieve industry-leading accuracy. Not only have we fixed the issues associated with biometrics ‚Äì we ve revolutionized the technology. Where accuracy matters? The industry-leading accuracy rate of our algorithm (99.98%), when deployed in a biometric identity management solution, results in dramatically lower error rates and greatly increased security and convenience. It also results in better performance in latent prints / poor quality image matching, enterprise 1:N identification (with only 1-2 fingers), hard to recognize prints / edge cases and enhanced performance on platforms with limited features (mobile & embedded). Innovatrics  industry-leading accuracy, identification speed and enrollment (extraction) speed, combined with agile design and low RAM consumption, mean our technologies are first in the world in operational ranking. Excellent Interoperability: Top results in interoperability and accuracy. Our technology consistently achieves top results in interoperability evaluations. Interoperability describes the extent to which systems and devices can exchange data, and interpret that shared data. For two systems to be interoperable, they must be able to exchange data and subsequently present that data such that it can be understood by a user. Why interoperability matters? Interoperability is critical in large biometric authentication projects. Many large biometric authentication systems in government agencies, financial institutions or large organisations are based on the rudimentary requirement of fingerprint template interoperability. Our vast experience has helped us to ensure that our fingerprint templates enable every certified matcher to gain maximum accuracy, and our template matcher delivers first class accuracy with every interoperable fingerprint template. Multiple Platform: Ready to run on a complete range of hardware and software platforms. We don t bind our customers to any kind of hardware or software. We have designed our biometric technologies to be ready to run on a broad range of hardware and software platforms, meaning customers don t need to worry about compatibility issues. The biometric solution you select today must be able to integrate with the technologies of tomorrow.  We are able to port our components and libraries also to unusual platforms and those with limited computing power and memory. Why it matters?

Award winning technology. Valued global contributors. The iProov story. Why was iProov founded? It came from a lesson learned the hard way. In 2008 Founder Andrew Bud was Executive Chairman of the previous business he founded, mBlox Inc. the largest provider of enterprise-to-consumer text messaging in the world. By 2007 it was also one of the largest processors of SMS mobile payments in the world, clearing and settling around $500m a year, with low fraud rates, growing revenues and happy mobile operators. The attack. Then in 2008, it all went horribly wrong. Fraudsters in the UK discovered how to fake consumer consents and many people lost money. Andrew was held to account by the press, and the company asked if it had been complicit or just negligent.  The answer, of course, was neither and the business was later commended by the regulator on its exemplary handling of the incident. The lesson. But it taught Andrew a lesson: the crucial importance of good, strong authentication. Simple enough to serve the needs of impatient mobile users, but secure enough to withstand the attention of even the most determined, sophisticated attackers.  Solving the SMS problem was straightforward. Solving the app and web problem was not. A new kind of solution was needed ‚Äì intuitive, simple to use, cross-platform, impervious to compromise of the device or its software and immune to phishing. How might this be achieved?  The answer became iProov. The future. iProov continues to be trusted throughout the online ecosystem by delivering authentication and verification simply and securely, based on a genuine one-time biometric.  Ensuring the genuineness of a biometric is and will continue to be one of the great continuing challenges for the online ecosystem.  iProov will continue to lead by meeting that challenge, through unceasing research and development, observing and adapting to the changing threats and through collaboration with a worldwide network of trusted partners. World leading technology. Presentation attack detection (PAD) and face matching are the two outstanding capabilities of iProov s core one-time biometric technology. We deliver these with exceptional usability through our patented user interface and Flashmarks. Our systems are resilient and adaptive. All our technology is our own IPR.

522,Is It You,Israel,2012,Private,0,0,1,0,0,0,https://www.isityou-online.com/,https://www.isityou-online.com/,,"PREVENT BIOMETRIC FRAUD. Introducing IDENTITY BEWARE from IsItYou. WHAT WE DO: Biometric Fraud Prevention Biometric modalities (face, eyes, voice) as identity means are rapidly emerging as the preferred choice to replace old passwords. Unlike passwords which can be changed, such identities are irreplaceable (something you are) and become high priority cyber attack targets. IsItYou uses AI-powered behavioral based technology as a security layer over such biometric modalities. It scans for potential fraud activity and keep consumers safe. IsItYou defines a new security standard to establish secure, trusted and personalized links between customers and the brands with which they carry out business. BEWARE: Safe Biometrics. Bottom Line: Is This User Human? There should be little doubt that passwords are on their way out with more advanced solutions taking over the market for authentication. Modern biometric modalities (face, eyes, voice) are rapidly emerging as preferred choices to replace old passwords. Unlike passwords that can be replaced, such identities are irreplaceable (something you are) and so become high priority cyber-attack targets. IsItYou developed deep AI-powered technology that can be layered over such authentication modalities to scan for potential fraud activity and keep consumers safe. IsItYou s Identity Biometric Early Warning Rating Engine (BEWARE) defines a new security standard to establish trusted and personalized links between customers and the brands with which they carry out business. Modern biometrics provide automated methods for individual authentication of a person by distinctive physical or behavioural characteristics, or both, that generate a unique biometric identity. The weakest aspect of any biometric modality is impersonation ‚Äìthe ability to circumvent the biometric authenticator and pretend that the subject under test is a real human being whereas in reality it is not‚Äì resulting in a fake biometric identity. The distinction whether a subject is a real human being or anything else is a multi-dimensional that cannot be addressed by simple, one-factor solutions. Based on a strong AI foundation, IsItYou has developed a technology that Fuses certain Physical body characteristics, Behavioural action patterns, Cognitive user reactions and Context-specific background geometries into a multi-class, deep self-learning engine capable of classifying biometric cyber-attacks. BEWARE s fusion process preserves the each biometric modality s markers for universality, uniqueness, and permanence while at the same time raising its resilience to impersonation attacks. Over 10 million of impersonation events across a wide range of situations were studied and classified over the course of five years. The findings from this effort were used to provide IsItYou s BEWARE with the very strong capability to differentiate between real and fake biometric identities. ONLY HUMANS ALLOWED Humans are complex creatures. They look a certain way, diffract light in a specific manner, their normal behavior includes recognizable traits. We combine user psychology, computer vision, sensor fusion, and ergonomics in a complex multi-layered analysis that provides you with a simple answer: Are they HUMAN? How to Prevent Bio-Identity Fraud? Frequently Asked Questions. I already have a face recognition solution, what can BEWARE add to it? Simply put: we can layer our impostor detector solution to whatever you ve already deployed. We can easily integrate with all major face recognition vendors to provide you and your users with an authentication solution you can truly trust. Really, it will work with other biometric engines? Yes. You can deploy IsItYou s BEWARE as an overlay to your current face recognition technology and for every recognized user it will give you an answer to the question: Are. They. Human? It sounds great, but what does the technology actually do? BEWARE integrates into your existing authentication solution and works with it to provide you with the ultimate in secure biometric authentication. BEWARE goes to work AFTER your biometric system has given the ""go ahead."" BEWAREgoes to work after your user has been successfully authenticated (it would be silly to scrutinize someone that was not even recognized by the system). Multiple layers and multiple factors are brought into the mix to determine whether the user that was just ""recognized"" is in fact the right human being. I ve heard about ""liveness detection."" Is this it? Yes it is, in more ways than one. In today s jargon, ""liveness"" detection is really motion detection. Put simply, it looks for things like blinking (movement of the eyelids), smiling, or a shake of the head. It assumes that all fraud attempts will be come in the form of a static photograph. IsItYou is different. We layer a number of methodologies that provide orthogonal responses to an authentication event. IsItYou uses an intelligent agent that adapts itself to the circumstance and helps the legitimate user reach a successful authentication. Our Technology. CONVENIENT: Convenience drives usage. To build a truly secure system it must be usable, and all things being equal, a more convenient security measure will be used more, and with higher policy-compliance than one that is cumbersome. ‚Äã BEWARE was built with this principle in mind. It examines a user s log-in attempt in the background, with none or almost no participation from the user. It requires no effort to comply, so people naturally use it more, and better. MULTI-LAYERED: BEWARE uses literally dozens of tests to determine whether a subject is truly a human or not. These tests, or ""filters,"" each work orthogonally to render a score. These scores are then analyzed to come up with a straight-forward answer. Having dozens of tests means that there is no single point of failure. No single filter that, if fooled, would render a false-positive determination. ENGINE AGNOSTIC: You may already have an authentication engine for mobile that uses face or eye biometrics. If so, we will be happy to add BEWARE S unique capabilities to your solution and upgrade its resilience in short order. If however, you do not already have a biometric solution, we will be happy to include IsItYou s own face recognition for you to use.",https://www.isityou-online.com/,11,2.01E+13,2.02E+13

We design street furniture that will develop or reinforce the identity of the site where it is located. From streetlights to mobile charging stations, we design street furniture and services that provide practical everyday benefits. From design to installation and upkeep, our street furniture and services are financed by advertising. From electric bikes to Wi-Fi hotspots, we continue to develop new services to meet your evolving needs. Our goal is to surprise and entertain you around the city with more interactive and creative advertising. OUT-OF-HOME ADVERTISING Activities In 1964, Jean-Claude Decaux invented advertising street furniture. Ever since, JCDecaux‚Äînow the global industry leader‚Äîhas been the only international player focused exclusively on outdoor advertising, developing 3 areas of business: street furniture, transport advertising and billboard advertising. OUR MISSION. Always keep innovating, for everyone s benefit. JCDecaux designs, installs and maintains a range of free or low-cost services for the benefit of cities, residents and travellers, including bus shelters, self-service bicycle schemes, passenger information panels and mobile charging terminals. These services are financed by advertisements that are located in busy thoroughfares, offering brands maximum visibility. Because it benefits all stakeholders‚Äîlocal governments, advertisers and users‚Äîthis business model is unique and sustainable, and has been a constant source of innovation for the past 50 years. It is adaptable to society s changing needs, as can be seen today in the integration of connectivity solutions. STREET FURNITURE. Inventor and global leader. Street furniture combines advertising with public services for city residents and travellers. Since the invention of advertising bus shelters in 1964, we have continuously improved and diversified our products. Our innovations are helping realise the vision of smart cities while providing the latest solutions to advertisers. Today, 3,890 cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants place their trust in JCDecaux. FOCUS. Cyclocity, leader in self-service bike rental scheme. Cyclocity¬Æ is a self-service bicycle scheme for cities. Its design is the outcome of years of work by our multi-disciplinary teams from the Industrial Division, the Graphic Arts Department, the IT Systems Division and the Innovation and Interactive Products Division. The Group continues to innovate to meet the needs of cities and their inhabitants, as can be seen in its 2015 launch of self-service hybrid bicycles with personal, portable battery. TRANSPORT ADVERTISING. Number 1 worldwide. JCDecaux manages advertising concessions in airports, metro systems, bus systems, trains and light rail. In line with our business model, we also take care of the design, installation, maintenance and financing of services like Wi-Fi connections and mobile charging terminals. We are constantly innovating to meet passengers  evolving needs. BILLBOARD ADVERTISING. Number one in Europe. Billboards are the oldest form of outdoor advertising. JCDecaux has revolutionised this medium by focusing on qualitative solutions. With innovations like scrolling panels, iconic giant displays and wall-wraps for fa√ßades, advertisers achieve maximum impact. These spaces are strategically located and fit harmoniously into their surroundings. FOR PARTNERS True to its sustainable business model, JCDecaux offers a vast array of services for inhabitants and passengers in urban environments. OUR DRIVE Innovation JCDecaux was created thanks to an innovation: the advertising bus shelter. And with it arrived a new business model: street furniture financed by advertising. We haven t stopped innovating ever since, continuously offering more services while enhancing the surrounding environment. CREATION. An ongoing approach. JCDecaux s success has always been grounded in a unique spirit of innovation and an ambitious Research & Development policy. The effectiveness of this strategy can be seen in all of our products and services. Cyclocity self-service bikes are now a must-have all around the world, and interactive screens and Wi-Fi terminals are appearing everywhere in cities and on transport systems.  Innovation enables us to anticipate constantly changing needs, to contribute to the design of the city of tomorrow and to help make transportation systems more enjoyable for passengers. IN-HOUSE EXPERTISE. Four pillars of innovation. JCDecaux s innovations meet four criteria: quality, style, functionality and environmental performance, which means adhering to eco-friendly design (strength, durability, low energy consumption and the use of recyclable materials). Only the longstanding multidisciplinary expertise offered by JCDecaux can meet such exacting requirements. Our 120 engineers and technicians working in R&D handle 400 projects a year. At any given time, our teams are working on 50 ongoing projects. ADAPTABILITY. Anticipating new forms of usage. JCDecaux is a company with a local presence, whose solutions interact daily with users in over 80 countries. This proximity inspires us and drives us to continuously adapt to changes in technology, user behaviour and client needs. Accordingly, JCDecaux s R&D efforts have evolved to incorporate new partners like start-ups and research centres directly into the innovation process. This new structure has also facilitated collaborative efforts to upgrade existing street furniture, which are essential to keeping up with the growing complexity of digital platforms. AWARDS. Recognition of our creative solutions. Our ongoing pursuit of excellence in design and sustainable development has been recognised on numerous occasions. Over the years, JCDecaux has won Good Design Awards (the world s oldest and most prestigious award of its type) and Green Good Design Awards for the quality, style and sustainability of its product designs. WHERE STYLE MEETS SERVICE Design JCDecaux offers accessible services to meet the daily needs of all. Quality and style are essential components of these services, resulting in street furniture that is as attractive as it is practical. HIGH STANDARDS, EVERY DAY Cleaning & Maintenance JCDecaux is recognised by cities, transport authorities and advertisers for the quality of its maintenance and upkeep services, which contribute to each location s appeal every day. CLOSER, MORE RESPONSIVE AND MORE FLEXIBLE Digital JCDecaux s attractive digital screens offer a new way to inform and advertise that is effective, customised and responsive. IN REAL TIME. The right message, at the right place, at the right time. Digital screens by JCDecaux are placed in busy thoroughfares, where they are visible daily to residents and travellers. For cities and transport authorities, they offer a responsive solution that can deliver a wide range of messages in real time, like weather, traffic, event announcements and alerts. Their flexibility also makes it possible to broadcast a customised message at a specific place and time. For example, an airport can greet travellers exiting a plane in the language of their country of origin. Digital screens offer adaptability and targeted information, whatever the need. DIGITAL COMMUNICATION. Impact and engagement. Thanks to their visibility and stylish design, JCDecaux s digital platforms can enhance the impact of communication campaigns by cities and transport authorities. A truly complementary solution, they can also be combined with other forms of media, with the option of using the same editorial line and graphic elements. Connected and context-responsive, they can even be linked in real time to social networks like Twitter and Facebook. They provide a flexible and effective addition to a comprehensive, multi-channel strategy. Distributing content on entertainment, culture, news and more, the digital platforms provide an enhanced experience for residents and travellers. INTERACTIVE DIGITAL PLATFORMS. Smart service. Interactive digital platforms are equipped with screens that inform residents and travellers about their city.

We are moved by knowing that with our work and knowledge, we contribute to peoples  well-being, through improving companies and organizations whose products and services are translated in better life quality for them. AVANT-GARDE IS WHERE WE ARE AT. ONLY THE BEST ARE PART OF OUR TEAM. WE TRULY LISTEN THE NEEDS. POSITIVES WHEN FACING CHALLENGES. EVERY PROBLEM HAS A SOLUTION. WE BREAK PARADIGMS AND CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO. This technology and innovation company began in 2004, when our founder Edmundo Casas, a recent graduate in Electronic Engineering from the ""Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a"" in Chile, started selling equipment to set up school s physics laboratories and because he prepared boxes of 10 watts of power that equaled one-hundredth of the 745.5 watts of a Horse Power, he decides to call his, at that time Start-up, Colt Power Ideas , being ""Potrillo"" the Spanish word for Colt. The company quickly begins to grow and Edmundo invites his friend Cristian Romero, also an Electronic Engineer from the same university, to join as co-founder and during the company s first 4 years they focused on the development of innovative technology products for entertainment, culture, and education purposes. The year of Chile s Bicentennial celebration (2010), brought the first investors interested in making the Colt grow, which resulted in Alejandra Mustakis betting on us and joining the team as a key player for the growth of the company as we know it. It was her father, Mr. Constantino Mustakis, who suggested that it was time to grow and from that day we stopped being a ""Colt"". This is how in 2010, we released a new name, and became Kauel , which means ""Faul"" in Mapudungun (Chileans second native language), while creating the hologram pyramid, an invention made with one of our own patents, which burst into the marketing industry and also received the Best Invention Award of the year , awarded by Chilean Ministry of Economy. In 2012, our invention our Kinect technology is awarded the President of the Republic Award as the most Innovative Development and this in conjunction with our developments placed us at the center of innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship of the country. The following year, we are once again recognized, this time by the Chamber of Commerce and ProChile, for exporting technology and having the Papalote and the Culiacan Museum in Mexico as our clients, exhibiting our technology. By 2015 we decided on a new strategic path towards other industries and found new opportunities in the service, power supply, oil, mining, retail, and health sectors to deliver high-value solutions. This aroused interest in the company once again, and that is how in 2018 we added new investment partners to our board of directors. This time is INVEXOR Capital , who sees in us a strong company with the possibility of placing Chile on the map of the technological vanguard, with Kauel being the epicenter of the Industry 4.0 in Chile and Latin America. Technologies We use to change the world... WE SPECIALIZE IN: Artificial Intelligence (AI) It is the artificial imitation of human intelligence processes done by machines. These processes include learning (the acquisition of data and rules for the use of information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or final conclusions) and self-correction. Virtual Reality (VR) It is an environment composed by different scenes and virtual objects of real appearance generated by computer technology, which gives the user the feeling of being immersed in it. Augmented Reality (AR) It refers to the real-time insertion, of virtual elements within the physical universe. A person can observe the real world with certain elements added, which appear in their lenses or screen as digital information, through the use of lenses or other special devices. Internet of Things (I.o.T) The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of connected computing devices. These are mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that have unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data through a network, without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions. Big Data (BD) Big Data is a term that describes the large volume of data, both structured and unstructured, which are generated from processes. But it is not the amount of data that is important, what matters with Big Data is what companies and organizations can do with it. & Nbsp; Big Data can be analyzed to get ideas and trends & nbsp; that lead to better decisions and strategic business movements. Analytics It is responsible for analyzing and shaping the information, in a friendly way, used for decisions decision making on different aspects such as processes, Web, e-Commerce, companies or brand in general.

JAY OLSHANSKY, OUR CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF SCIENCE OFFICER, HAS PUBLISHED A NEW WHITE PAPER ON: Longevity and Health of U.S. Presidential Candidates for the 2020 Election. AI-POWERED LIFE EVENT PREDICTION IS HERE. At Lapetus Solutions, world-renowned scientists leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop revolutionary new ways to predict life events in real time, combining: Sensory Analytics An emerging science-based technology that uses digital images to examine an individual s physical features to determine longevity, health status and disease susceptibility. Life Sciences Combining decades of longevity research with biodemography at the core, specific covariates linked to longevity are identified and predictive algorithms are generated. Dynamic Questioning Scientifically formulated questions that change according to responses provide more insight and accuracy into individual longevity than standardized questionnaires. CHANGING THE FACE OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING. CHRONOS While traditional underwriting can take up to a month, CHRONOS delivers more accurate results in seconds Combining facial analytics, biodemographic information and dynamic questioning, CHRONOS returns precise and reliable scores. How Industry is Using Our Tools. Lapetus Solutions Inc. (LSI) integrates science and technology with machine learning to develop tools and platforms that enable industries relying on life event prediction to reduce and replace their dependence on traditional assessment methods with faster, more cost-effective and increasingly accurate results. By combining Life Sciences, Sensory Analytics and Dynamic Questioning to provide real time insight into an individual s health status and longevity, as well as to examine risk within specific groups, our tools also combine to form the basis of three breakthrough customer engagement platforms, delivering fully customizable, end-to-end solutions for the life insurance and financial planning industries. Our team is comprised of internationally recognized scientists in their fields, including Biodemography, Facial Analytics, Health, Aging and Data Science. Working together and drawing from the data and research of thousands of global experts, they leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to more accurately predict life events in real time, including mortality, morbidity and healthy lifespan. Lapetus was the Greek god of mortality. Our first platform, Chronos, is named after his brother, the Greek god of time. The panels represent the three phases of life according to evolution biology: childhood, adulthood and old-age, through which a mortality curve runs, reflecting the fundamental linkage between biology and duration of life that is at the foundation of Lapetus biodemographic thinking and methods. Life Sciences: Combining decades of longevity research with biodemography at the core, specific covariates linked to lifespan are identified and predictive algorithms are generated. Through the compilation, distillation and analysis of complex and constantly evolving data from thousands of global researchers, our scientists assess and identify market-specific trends, linking specific questions to mortality risk and survival prospects. All of the following are taken into account in calculating results: anthropology, ecology, embryology, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, genetics, molecular biology, pathology and population genetics. Our Life Sciences tools can be used to provide: Life Expectacy (LE) and Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) estimates Trend analysis on blocks of insured populations Mortality trends using Live Life Tables. Sensory Analytics An emerging science-based technology that uses digital images to examine an individual s physical features to determine longevity, health status and disease susceptibility. LSI scientists use machine learning techniques to build sensory analytics algorithms that provide real time results. They are currently researching the enhanced information that sight, voice and skin-based analytics can provide and will continue to develop new algorithms and corresponding tools based on their findings. From just a simple selfie, our Facial Analytics technology examines 100 s of points and 1000 s of regions on the face to instantly provide: BMI calculation Estimated Age Gender Smoking Indication. Dynamic Questioning Scientifically formulated questions that change according to responses provide more insight and accuracy into individual longevity than standardized questionnaires. For years, traditional methods of predicting life events have relied on asking the same types of questions. The Lapetus platform uses a range of highly predictive and variable questions based on aging science that change dynamically based on initial responses, providing results that are unique to each individual. Dynamic Questioning enables us to identify people who are likely to live exceptionally long lives, even in the face of potentially harmful behavioral risk factors. Not all smokers are equal By combining Life Sciences, Dynamic Questioning and Sensory Analytics, it is now possible to identify smokers who are likely to live longer, as well as detect when someone has not been truthful about their past and present smoking habits on an application form. Based on our two key areas of scientific study, Life Event Sciences and Sensory Analytics, we have developed a variety of customizable, risk assessment tools that can be used individually or in combination. They are grounded in algorithms using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, continually improving with more data. Everything you need to know about our proprietary data collection initiative.

Thank you all of the GLOMO AWARDS committee for recognizing the developments we are making in this world. LetinAR, a trailblazer to a bumpy road of defective optics for AR devices. Founded in 2016, LetinAR Inc, a startup company made its appearance in the scene of Augmented Reality presenting a new paradigm-changing technology ‚Äì PinMR‚Ñ¢ lens. This technology was developed mainly to redress common failings found in current products; heavy and expensive hardware, and deficient functions that inhibit the construction of real eyeglasses-shaped designs and render wearability and usability mediocre at best. Accurate Color Expression: An Edge over diffraction-based or reflection-based systems. Light and Thin: Super-Thin Pin Mirror Lens. Expanded DoF: Shows Augmented Reality (AR) Image wihtout inducing dizziness. PinMR‚Ñ¢, Next-generation AR optic technology. Numerous AR global leaders have been diversely attempting to endeavor to develop AR devices using the Half-Mirror Combiner, Diffractive/Holographic Waveguide or Geometrical Waveguide, yet they have not met end-users  needs and expectations. This is mainly owing to bulky form factors, narrow FoV, poor color expression, high prices, and costly and complex manufacturing mainly caused by the complex structure of the optical system. All these issues vitiate the widespread commercialization of AR devices.  PinMR‚Ñ¢ technology LetinAR invented was inspired by the pinhole effect, the process of placing a pinhole before the human retina resulting in clearer images of the object. By switching pinholes with tiny mirrors, the light from a micro-display can be reflected and guided into the pupils. The mirrors are invisible to the human eye ‚Äì seamlessly along with real-world images. PinMR‚Ñ¢ with its incomparable performance resolves the issues identified by consumers and AR companies so far, establishing itself as the frontrunner of the field.

Only you can access this information, since each of the app s advanced features is protected by biometric security. Instant payment receipts Block your payment cards Limits Spending categories (coming soon). This is what the future looks likeYou didn t realise that this was even possible. So we created exclusive tools for you, before you could have even dreamt them up. A universal card linked to all your accounts Dynamic virtual cards A universal IBAN account (coming soon) Joint accounts. Who is Lydia? Lydia is a payment app that aims at simplifying the way we re managing our money. You can now pay anywhere, send money instantly, share expenses and manage your accounts using your mobile. To achieve this ambitious goal, Lydia brought together a team of experts specialised in payment methods and mobile payment security, and joined forces with the very best partners in French banking: Payline (Cr√©dit Mutuel group) to acquire and conserve data relating to bank cards as well as the Soci√©t√© Financi√®re du Porte Monnaie √âlectronique Interbancaire (SFPMEI) to manage and guarantee all transfers. Our mission: Make your payments easier. At the moment, how you pay is dictated by where you are and who you re paying. Cash at the cornershop, a cheque at the doctor s, card for online purchases, or a bank transfer to pay back a friend. This is hardly very practical, and is often extremely frustrating - especially when the nearest ATM is good ten minutes  walk away, and it s raining. In the age of smartphones, online payments, and the ""cloud"", it s strange that we re still using pieces of metal and paper to make payments. Why can t there be one, simple, universal means of payment to pay for anything, anywhere? That s what was keeping us up at night when we launched Lydia in 2013 with one goal: to be able to pay for anything easily, quickly, and securely with the one object you always have on you. Your phone. Lydia is the labour of love of a team of very passionate, extremely ambitious, and slightly crazy people. We have made it our personal mission to push the boundaries, break down the barriers between us and a cashless society, and to encourage the rise of mobile payments globally. We re a demanding bunch, obsessed with finding the optimal technological, design, and legal solutions to build the best payment app in the world. Technology is cool, but it shouldn t be an end in itself. For us, the real goal is to make life easier - by using the latest, cutting-edge technology. That s exactly what we re trying to do with mobile payments: we re not interested in building a trendy gadget that you get bored of after a week, and, above all, you shouldn t be held hostage to a particular app, platform, or bank. We believe that mobile payments must provide a real solution to a genuine problem. Everything we do is guided by common sense and our universal ambition: a service for everything and everyone. So, who s Lydia? Well, the name actually comes from the kingdom of Lydia (part of present-day Turkey), where the first coins were minted around the seventh century B.C. The kingdom became rich from these coins made from electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver, that was abundant in the river Pactole. Croesus was the last and most famous of the kings of Lydia. Pactole and Croesus entered into legend, and are used in modern parlance to symbolise wealth. We chose the name ""Lydia"" as a playful nod from modern techology to the entire history of money. A team of experts. Thanks to our first-class banking partners, we can assure a high level of security. We select the French leaders to work with...Lydia is a mobile app that lets you pay instantly using your phone. Lydia is designed and verified in France according to the highest standards of banking and IT security. Asymmetrical RSA keys, symmetrical 256-bit data encryption, SSL communications, personal data anonymisation...

Privacy blurring: All Mapillary imagery is anonymized for privacy compliance. Our deep learning based algorithms are optimized for blurring faces and license plates on street-level images. Image segmentation: Each image is pixel-wise labeled with 97 object classes. We have the best-performing algorithm for semantic segmentation of road imagery, based on Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas benchmarks. 3D reconstruction: Mapillary uses Structure from Motion to find the relative positions of images and create smooth transitions between them. Our OpenSfM pipeline is available as open source. Traffic sign recognition: We detect more than 1,500 types of traffic signs in 100 countries. When the same sign appears in multiple images, its position in space is triangulated and the traffic sign is extracted as a map feature. Mapillary platform: Host, process, and publish street-level imagery and map data. Make imagery available and access data on the collaborative platform that uses computer vision to scale and automate mapping. Turn images into street-level views and map data. Collaborate with your team and our contributor network. About us: Mapillary is the street-level imagery platform that uses computer vision to fix the world s maps. Who we are: Mapillary brings together a global network of contributors who want to make the world accessible to everyone by visualizing the world and building better maps. Anyone can join and collect street-level images, using simple tools like smartphones or action cameras. With computer vision, we connect images across time and space to create immersive street-level views and extract map data. Since 2013: Mapillary was founded in 2013 with the goal of making street-level imagery and map data available to everyone. 190 countries: Mapillary members have contributed hundreds of millions of images in countries all over the world. We believe that people and organizations working together in the open is the best way to collect, visualize and understand data about our world. Mapillary is not tied to any particular mapping platform and is based on the idea of people and organizations with various motives sharing data and helping each other. Our team s mission is to build technology and tools to help understand the world s places through images and make this data available. We want everyone to be able to use our data to make better maps, create a safer traffic environment, develop our cities, visualize places and stories, and help people in vulnerable places. The team. The Mapillary team is distributed and asynchronous. People work where they want, when they want ‚Äî from the Pacific to the Australian Eastern time zone. With headquarters in Malm√∂ and subsidiaries in New York and Graz, the place where work really happens is our global virtual office. Manifesto. Mapillary has grown into a worldwide network of collaborators, with people and organizations having mapped millions of kilometers across 190 countries. That s literally a long way from where we started in 2013. Here s the founding manifesto we wrote when we first started out. At Mapillary we want to create an image representation of the world, a map with images of every place on Earth.   Current street view alternatives have so many limitations from the fact that they are created using cars with camera rigs, focusing on streets. There are many places on this planet that they will never get to, and even the places they do get to will not get updated as often as you might want them to. Together we can fix that. In order to build this globally, we need your help! If your neighborhood or town is missing street view, go out and map it with Mapillary. If your business has no street view, take images of it and the roads leading there with Mapillary. If you want to share your favorite hike or bike ride, map it with Mapillary. We are committed to making the most out of every single upload and creating the best possible experience with your contributions.   Take images. Take lots of images. There is no limit to the level of detail you can add or the places you can go. Don t take tens of images, take hundreds or thousands at a time. The more the better. Our servers can handle it, your phone can handle it. The time is right. We are now at a point in time where the tools and infrastructure to make this happen are widely available. Phones have great cameras, good GPS, and enough storage to hold thousands of high quality images. Internet connectivity for uploading these images is widespread. Large scale compute infrastructure is available and scalable to mind boggling levels.   Here are some good examples that show what a decent amount of images can do, all crowdsourced from real people like you. Malm√∂, Davos, Venice Beach, Bj√§rred, Dresden.   Mapillary is an independent and neutral provider of street-level imagery and map data, untied to any particular mapping platform. We are committed to building a global service for everyone. Go out, make a difference using the phone you have in your pocket everyday.",https://www.mapillary.com/,1495,2.01E+13,2.03E+13

Micro Focus IDOL, a search and analytics engine that delivers actionable intelligence from structured and unstructured data. Within the first 18 months, the system helped Dubai Police capture over 2,700 individuals. Zenith Gulf Security Systems began working with the Dubai Police in 2007, when Zenith first approached the police to introduce a new mobile ANPR solution. Previously, an officer with a printed list of wanted plates would comb through parking lots and garages full of cars and occasionally find a match. Now they have instant access to the latest data. Due to the success of ANPR, the Dubai Police has since expanded their capability with version 2 of the system, which offers an even wider range of detection for wanted plates and incorporates 360 degree video surveillance, all embedded discretely in the patrol car s roof-mounted light bar. Challenge To significantly improve effectiveness, the Dubai Police needed to automate the identification process through the use of technology. The system needed to work day and night and read a wide range of number plate styles within the seven Emirates of the UAE, which incorporate both English and Arabic lettering and different color codes. They also needed the ability to find and track wanted vehicles in moving traffic, but ensure up-to-the-minute data updates so only those still wanted would be ID d. Solution Real-time Response on Busy City Streets ""This technology combines high-end cameras and Micro Focus IDOL, which enables capturing an enormous amount of raw data rapidly and making sense of it almost instantly. And this system had to be extremely user-friendly for law enforcement; they can t be bogged down with hard-to-use technology on the job,"" says Russell Hammad, CEO of Zenith Gulf Security Systems, which developed the ANPR system. The original ANPR system featured a readily visible pan-tilt camera device mounted above a patrol car s light bar. It was designed primarily for scanning parked cars in garages and lots, but was also capable of scanning license plates immediately in front or behind a moving patrol car. The new system (which they rolled out in 2015) provides a more visually subtle integration of 12 cameras into the light bar, along with the ability to read license plates up to three lanes to the right or left of a patrol car, even at high traffic speeds. ""The display on the officer s dashboard shows a picture of the suspect vehicle as well as the highlighted plate data, plus a voice message as part of the alert,"" says Hammad. ""A screen comes up, shows you the image of the car, as well as all relevant records pertaining to the vehicle and why it has been identified."" Respecting, and Protecting, the Citizens of Dubai In determining requirements for the original ANPR system, Dubai Police wanted to ensure frequent updates to the data replicated to patrol cars, which only carry the license plate data for wanted vehicles; the main IDOL repository is maintained at headquarters. ""The deltas are downloaded to patrol cars every three minutes, so that drivers who were, say, delinquent in paying a fine or fee at 8:00 a.m., but have taken care of the charges at 10:00 a.m., will not be pulled over needlessly later in the day,"" says Hammad. ""People don t want to be inconvenienced, and the Dubai Police want this system to be well-received. As the main database is updated, the patrol cars get updated‚Äîalmost in real time."" On the other side of this equation, the Dubai Police are a renowned security apparatus in the UAE. To assist patrol units during emergencies, Zenith designed a push function to alert police regarding vehicles that have suddenly become wanted. ""For example, if there s a robbery and the getaway car has been ID d, the license information is immediately pushed out to all patrol cars along with any image of the vehicle, including a GPS coordinate of where the ID was made,"" says Hammad. The Heat Is On Creating the ANPR system involved more than the interface of IDOL with display screens inside police cars. Placing a sensitive camera system on top of a police car creates a high- heat issue, especially in Dubai, where the sun can cause a car s rooftop temperatures to go as high 60-70 degrees Celsius (140-150 degrees Fahrenheit). ""So, in every camera there s a dual camera optic system for redundancy and failover,"" explains Hammad. ""These are high quality cameras suited for what s called an IP-68 environment; they are very insulated for the temperature conditions."" Results ""Being able to connect in real time, and being able to respond in real time, is what this is all about,"" says Hammad. ""The Dubai Police are very forward thinking. They see the vision, and because they are known as leaders in municipal security, we have a number of other police forces in the region who are keenly discussing similar implementations of this technology."" With advanced cameras at the ready, Facial Recognition has become a new area of interest for this system‚Äîand given IDOL s abilities to connect to video and other visual data systems on a large scale, and to deliver high performance video and image analytics, this is something Zenith is beginning to explore. ""This is no longer a simple ANPR system. With version 2, Micro Focus IDOL s integrated analytics can help us go beyond license plates with its extensive support for video, sensors, text, and audio data. The ability to leverage, say, sentiment analysis of social media data, will allow us to more effectively uncover and respond to suspicious behaviors and pertinent information in a much more efficient manner. It s truly impressive what can be done to capitalize on all this data,"" says Hammad.

The future of air travel: Providing seamless, secure and efficient solutions for airports, airlines and governments across the globe. As many as 8.2 billion passengers will travel in 2037, a near doubling today s air passenger volume according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). When travelling, the customer journey and experience is often as important as the destination itself. However, increasing numbers of travelers also elevates the need for balancing efficient passenger processing with enhanced security measures. Airports and airlines are increasingly recognizing the need to adopt new strategies to proactively enable capacity growth, as well as lower operational costs, identify new revenue streams and ease passenger flow to enhance the overall travel experience. NEC is at the forefront of providing seamless, secure and efficient solutions for airports, airlines and governments across the globe to ultimately deliver an enhanced air traveler experience. Seamless Passenger Experience A passenger s information is stored on a single record, creating a trusted identity token for use at every in-airport touchpoint. Airport Security NEC s AI-based intelligent video analytics solutions ensure high quality ambient security. Airport Operations NEC s solutions are designed to enhance operational efficiencies in the face of increasing air passenger volumes. Air Traffic Control In order to efficiently manage air traffic, NEC offers an integrated Air Traffic Control System for en route and terminal air traffic. INTELLIGENTLY SECURE YOUR FACILITY. According to IATA s Global Passenger Survey 2017, passengers have identified airport security as one of their top two pain points. As airports become larger, busier and more sophisticated, so also must the security systems which are deployed, as traditional human and CCTV camera monitoring alone are no longer sufficient to ensure  safety and security within an airport. NEC has a 50-year history of providing next-generation security solutions to airports, and currently offers a variety of solutions which can intelligently secure your facility.  Some of our most recent innovations include behavior detection, crowd behavior analysis and enhanced video analytics. Behavior Detection LEARN FROM THE BEHAVIOR. NEC s behavior detection solution improves security reaction times by unobtrusively monitoring and reporting incidents within an airport. Our solution uses image recognition technology which can immediately identify and alert security personnel of incidents as they happen. Our system can loitering, sudden crowd formation, left objects, fallen people and unauthorized intrusions. Deploying this solution can significantly reduce the need for manual video feed monitoring and minimizes the chance of human error. Crowd Behavior Analysis GET BETTER CROWD CONTROL NEC s crowd behavior analysis solution offers real-time insights around crowd movement and density levels. Unusual crowd movements and a sudden rise in crowd levels, automatically generate alerts to warn security personnel. This empowers security operators to improve staffing efficiency and dynamically allocate resources for high priority tasks, improving checkpoint efficiency and reducing overall waiting times. NEC Enhanced Video Analytics NEC s Enhanced Video Analytics can help airport operators intelligently manage the extremely large amount of video footage which much be constantly monitored.  NEC Enhanced Video Analytics unites many of NEC s core technologies and services such as NeoFace Face Recognition and Behavior detection and also has added functions such as demographic and people counting and object recognition capabilities. All of these functionalities combined can help airport operators maintain a safe and secure environment. A SEAMLESS CURB-TO-GATE EXPERIENCE. According to the International Air Transport Association s 2019 Global Passenger Survey many aspects of the customer airport journey are lacking in terms of customer satisfaction.  Among the lowest-ranked airport customer experiences in terms of satisfaction include immigration (64%), security (66%) and bag drop (73%). NEC s technology supports this digital transformation by enabling a passenger s biometrics and travel information to be captured on a single record. This can then be used as a trusted token to identify the passenger to each stakeholder easily, eliminating the need for repetitive identity checks and ensuring process efficiencies at every touchpoint of the airport experience. New biometric technology available to passengers creates a better airport user experience and enables a fast and hassle-free journey from the curb side to the boarding gate. Passengers increasingly desire a comfortable travel experience when selecting an airline and an airport, which can be accomplished with biometric authentication. NEC s seamless passenger processing solution can be deployed across the entire passenger journey including at check-in, bag drop, security, immigration, lounge entry, retail stores and boarding. Face Recognition. World-leading Face Recognition for Multiple Industries. NEC s biometric face recognition technology is used worldwide for fighting crime, preventing fraud, securing public safety, and improving customer experience across a vast range of locations and industries. Why? Because independent NIST testing has repeatedly confirmed NEC s NeoFace recognition and matching capability as the world s fastest and most accurate across all benchmarks and challenging conditions.* It stems from over Half-century of biometric technology expertise. It couples recognition with real-time identification, verification and situation analysis for quick decision-making, preemptive security, and smoother services. Installed in over 1,000 major systems in more than 70 countries and regions worldwide, it boasts a stellar track record and wealth of practical experience. And finally, as the long-reputed industry leader, our face recognition solutions are also designed to offer solid protection for the public without encroaching on their privacy, freedoms or human rights. NEC, the Pioneer of Scalable Biometrics Border controls, airlines, airports, transport hubs, stadiums, mega events, concerts, conferences. Biometrics are playing a growing role not only in the real-time policing and securing of increasingly crowded and varied venues worldwide, but also in ensuring a smooth, enjoyable experience for the citizens who visit them. As a long-time committed pioneer of biometric research and solutions, NEC has developed multi-modal technologies including face, iris and voice recognition, finger- and palmprint identification, and ear acoustic authentication, and supplemented them with AI and data analytics to enhance situational awareness and facilitate effective real-time or post-event action in both law-enforcement and consumer-oriented spheres. Face recognition can often prove one of the best biometrics because images can be taken without touching or interacting with the individual being identified, and those images recorded and instantly checked against existing databases. NEC s face recognition offers high-performance, scalable solutions for the most demanding real-time or post-event requirements. With face surveillance, search, identification and verification functions all on a single platform, it can be easily integrated into existing surveillance systems to extract faces in real time, match against an existing database or watchlist and produce real-time alerts to help reduce public safety risks. With the ability to process and analyze multiple camera feeds and thousands of faces per minute, NEC s powerful face recognition is able to police the largest and most difficult security challenges with unparalleled efficiency, sensitivity, and perception. World-best Speed and Accuracy (NIST) The superior strength of NEC s face recognition technology lies in its outstanding tolerance of poor quality and conditions. This tolerance has repeatedly secured the top slot for NEC s technology range in independent tests conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States*, which declare our face recognition technology the most accurate in situations of varying levels of difficulties that reflect real life scenarios, with the fastest matching capability that is the most resistant to variants in angle and age. But just how good is NEC s face recognition technology in real life? NEC s technology can match a subject s face from images with resolutions as low as 24 pixels, even if the subject is on the move, or the face partially concealed by hats, scarves or glasses, or head angle. It also facilitates video surveillance of suspects in crowded, poorly lit areas at unmatched speed and volume in real time. NEC s face recognition technology does this by using long-tested algorithms that convert two-dimensional images into three-dimensional head images, which are then rotated in all directions and scrutinized using different vantage points, lighting situations, facial expressions and changes to help guarantee over 99% face-recognition accuracy in real-world situations. NEC Face Recognition in Action In response to booming demand for varied biometrics, NEC has expanded its traditional range of face recognition applications from law-enforcement and security provision to new areas, and now boasts more than 1,000 active systems in over 70 countries and regions spanning police department, immigration control agency, national ID, banking, entertainment, stadium, conference venue systems, and many more. Right now, many of our face recognition technology solutions are blazing a trail for first-time use in new areas and venues worldwide, such as end-to-end airport travel experiences in the U.S., mega event surveillance in Japan, and EU Summit security in Europe. In 2019, NEC was named Frost & Sullivan Asia Pacific Biometrics Company of the Year in recognition of its leading position in the industry and foresight in innovating and developing future face recognition biometric solutions that maximize customer value and experience. Balancing security and privacy As the leading global pioneer of face recognition and other biometric technologies, and champion of our NEC Safer Cities Vision, NEC is fully vested in developing biometric recognition solutions and services that contribute to the creation of safe, secure, equal and efficient communities around the world. Having positioned safety business as one of our key pillars of growth, we are keen to encourage businesses, consumers, and governments to work together to help balance the need for privacy with the benefits of protecting our society, securing our borders and providing consumer convenience without the fear of negative consequences. At NEC, we strongly believe that face recognition can add significant value to our lives, and we seek to advance these technologies in ways that respect the worldwide principals of freedom, justice, rights to privacy, transparency and continuous improvement. Biometric Authentication Realizing a safe and secure world with digital technology. Although society has become drastically convenient with digital technology, there are increased risks such as impersonation. This is why biometric authentication technology has become critical. NEC is the global leader in the field of biometric authentication.

Large-scale Biometric Solutions Biometric for Integrators Biometrics for End Users Biometric Scanners Video Surveillance Computer Vision Robotics & A.I. Ultrasound technologies. PROPRIETARY ALGORITHMS AND TECHNOLOGIES SINCE 1990. TECHNOLOGY AWARDS IN INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS. MILLIONS OF ALGORITHM DEPLOYMENTS WORLDWIDE. 500+ human-years of R&D experience. Technology proven in national-scale projects. Flexible licensing, transparent pricing. Unlimited, free technical support. COMPANY INFORMATION: Neurotechnology was founded in Vilnius, Lithuania in 1990 with the key idea of using neural networks for applications such as biometric person identification, computer vision, robotics and artificial intelligence. Much to our delight, we were able to endure the ""neural networks winter"" by using and expanding this expertise all through 2012, the year that brought explosive developments in the concept and infrastructure of deep neural networks. This allowed us to quickly take advantage of the emerging opportunities that came with the new wave of deep learning and triggered an entire range of new projects in object recognition and other applications. Currently, our team is comprised of more than 100 employees, 15% of whom hold a Ph.D. and half of our employees are actively involved in R&D activities. NEURAL NETWORKS AND AI In almost 30 years of our activity, we have accumulated substantial experience in the area of neural networks. This allowed us to develop a multitude of product capabilities based on deep learning as well as customer applications. Deep neural networks are able to solve many problems - such as image classification, object detection, or instance segmentation - more efficiently than traditional computer vision algorithms. To facilitate this process, we have built a technology that has tools to support developing AI-based object recognition applications. In the area of face recognition, the last few years witnessed a dramatic reduction in error rates brought by new algorithms that are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our company started using CNNs for the task of face recognition in 2013. The first application of neural networks alone resulted in an improvement in the accuracy of unconstrained face recognition by a factor of 15 times! We expect further improvements in face recognition performance due to explosive development of architectures and techniques related to CNNs. As deep learning techniques kept proliferating other areas, we were ultimately able to employ our face recognition algorithms under the conditions of real-time surveillance. By being able to recognize and track other objects - such as pedestrians and all kinds of vehicles (cyclists, bikes, cars, busses, trucks, etc.) - in adjacent video frames, we can extract various pieces of information about those objects, for example the color of the vehicle or the direction of its movement. There is a separate modality for recognizing license plates of vehicles using neural networks. Our latest improvements in other biometric modalities are also driven by extensive research in deep neural networks. This includes the most interoperable fingerprint algorithm in the world (ranked the first in the NIST MINEX interoperability category), the second most accurate iris recognition technology and the new version of our algorithm for speaker identification. As another illustration of our achievements in using deep learning, Neurotechnology s researchers won first place in the 2017 Kaggle competition with a computer vision solution for classifying fish species. We seek to distill our knowledge and understanding of how natural intelligence operates into deep-learning-based algorithms, and we see this approach as the shortest path toward achieving General AI. Neurotechnology also runs Deep Learning Paper Reviews, a series of open-access events devoted to sharing and discussing recent ideas in the field. BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS We have a reputation for developing a range of products for biometric identification of fingerprints, palm prints, faces, irises and voices. Since the release of our first fingerprint identification system, we have delivered more than 200 products and version upgrades for identification and verification of objects and personal identity. Over 3,000 system integrators, security companies and hardware providers in more than 140 countries integrate our algorithms into their products. With a combination of fast algorithms and high reliability, our company s fingerprint, face, iris, voice and palmprint biometric technologies can be used for access control, computer security, banking, time attendance control and law enforcement applications, among others. With millions of customer installations worldwide, our products are used for both civil and forensic applications, including border crossings, criminal investigations, systems for voter registration, verification and duplication checking, passport issuance and other national-scale projects. Neurotechnology s fingerprint identification algorithms have shown top results for reliability in major biometric competitions and evaluations, including the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) Minutiae Interoperability Exchange III (MINEX III), Proprietary Fingerprint Template Evaluation II (PFT II) and Fingerprint Vendor Technology Evaluation for the US Department of Justice (FpVTE 2012). Previously, the fingerprint recognition algorithms have received awards in the International Fingerprint Verification Competitions (FVC2006, FVC2004, FVC2002 and FVC2000). In 2018, our iris recognition algorithm was tested in the NIST Iris Exchange (IREX) Evaluation and was recognized as the second most accurate among those tested. The accelerated version of the algorithm was nearly 50 times faster than any other matching system in the NIST IREX IX evaluation. Previously, Neurotechnology showed outstanding results in the IREX, IREX III and IREX IV evaluations. In 2019 our palm print matching algorithm has shown the top result at the FVC-onGoing evaluation, being the most accurate overall and fastest among the five most accurate matchers. COMPUTER VISION To meet the demands of a variety of applications, we developed many advanced algorithms based on computer vision. For instance, they are used in SentiSight.ai, our interactive web platform for developing AI-based object recognition applications. The platform has tools designed to support interactive model training - without coding - and faster image labeling, thus reducing the amount of user effort spent on data mining. We also run projects tailored to the specific needs of our customers. Our technology for real-time surveillance was designed to support biometric face identification of moving pedestrians using live video streams from high-resolution digital cameras. The technology is used for passive identification, when passers-by do not make any efforts to be recognized. Possible uses for this technology include law enforcement, security, attendance control, visitor counting, traffic monitoring and other commercial applications. Some of our ealier R&D efforts related to computer vision also involved technologies for eye movement tracking and 3D object model reconstruction. ROBOTICS Our current R&D effort in robotics is focused on the ""programming by demonstration"" approach and its practical implementation in various neural network structures. During our experiments we not only gained experience with different types of neural networks (e.g., various CNN s, RNN s, including RNN s with external memory, the self modifying RNN and the CMP, Cognitive Mapping and Planning), we also developed our own theoretical innovations. SentiBotics, our ready-to-use robotics development kit, allows rapid development and testing of mobile robots. The kit includes a mobile robotic platform with a 3D vision system, a modular robotic arm and accompanying ROS-based software we have built on our own, with complete source code and programming samples. ULTRASOUND RESEARCH GROUP Our Ultrasound Research Group undertakes research in the fields of ultrasonic particle manipulation, parametric array and transducer technology. It develops novel algorithms, hardware and electronics solutions for ultrasonics applications. Currently, the group is developing a new, patent-pending 3D printing and assembling technology based on ultrasonic particle manipulation. This new technology is intended to expand capabilities of existing 3D printing and assembling processes. In 2018, the group also filed a patent for a novel ultrasonic electrostatic transducer technology. These transducers were developed primarily for use in parametric array systems. In 2019, Focusonics directional speaker, based on the patent-pending method of using ultrasonic waves to reproduce sound, was introduced.

665,Nok Nok Labs,United States,2011,Private,1,0,1,1,0,1,https://www.noknok.com/,https://www.onespan.com/security,no strong candidates; using root landing,"NOK NOK IS NEXT GENERATION AUTHENTICATION. From Telcos to Banks to Insurers to the Internet of Things, millions of people, apps and devices rely on next generation multi factor authentication solutions from Nok Nok Labs. Nok Nok, headquartered in San Jose, CA, was founded in November 2011 in order to unify the silos that are currently unable to meet authentication needs for modern computing. Nok Nok is the market leader in next generation authentication for cloud, mobile and IoT applications. The company s carrier-grade, web-scale authentication platform has been deployed to hundreds of millions of users through leading Mobile Network Operators, Fintech, Banking, Healthcare and IoT customers. Through the Nok Nok S3 Authentication Suite, the company provides the security and assurance of ""right user, right device and right context"" to realize frictionless delivery of services for superior customer experiences. The company is a pioneer in driving the adoption of passwordless next generation authentication that includes biometric, token or wearable-based authentication of devices and users on mobile, PC & IoT platforms to deliver strong, multi-factor authentication. Nok Nok is trusted by millions of users and by leading Fortune 500 enterprises everyday to connect, engage, transact with and service their customers to provide a secure and confident omni-channel digital experience. Nok Nok is a privately held company and is based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 2012 by a team of security industry veterans from companies such as PGP, PayPal, Phoenix, ValiCert, Sun Microsystems and Netscape with the vision that authentication lies at the heart of the security problem for every computing ecosystem.  Solving this problem requires us overcome the limitations of legacy authentication solutions such as passwords and OTPs (one-time-passwords). Those methods are subject to scalable attacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks that can be done remotely and be automated to cause maximum damage.  Nok Nok s innovations deliver plug and play authentication solutions that are simple, secure and scalable for three key constituencies ‚Äì end users, developers and IT support personnel. Nok Nok is the author of several key industry standards ratified by bodies such as the FIDO Alliance and the W3C. The company s innovation and IP extends well beyond its contribution to the standards community.  The Nok Nok team is sought after to consult and comment at industry forums and conferences and to regulatory bodies worldwide on best practices related to Identity & Authentication across many industries and are a trusted advisor to their customers. Why Authentication. Authentication is the weakest link in the chain of cyber security. Every year billions of dollars are invested in securing business through legacy authentication solutions such as password management, one-time passwords or fraud/risk management systems and firewall/VPN/intrusion systems. Beyond their costs, these systems create friction in customer interactions and complexity for IT and have proven ineffective against attacks on credentials. Despite the large investments, according to the 2017 Verizon Data Breach Incident Report, 81% of the reported data breaches were caused by a stolen or compromised credentials. These credentials themselves are used to mount attacks that have catastrophic consequences for brands, their customers and potentially for the ecosystems they participate in. To truly secure any computing ecosystem and prevent scalable attacks we need a modern way to secure our credentials that is simple, secure and scalable. The company is the visionary behind and one of the five founders of the FIDO Alliance, an industry group leading efforts to standardize password-less and multi-factor authentication. FIDO is changing how the world will authenticate in 21st century digital economy and is increasingly referenced by standards and regulatory bodies.  Nok Nok s innovations go beyond the limitations of individual authentication methods to deliver a framework approach that allows a plug-and-play approach to authentication. The company is an industry leader that innovates on top of a standards-based platform and has real-world deployments in the millions of users. Mobile Network Operators: Unlock new services and increase customer satisfaction with modern mobile authentication solutions.

Introducing Nymi Enterprise EditionTM Weak passwords, shared credentials, and lost badges all challenge the integrity of data in complex manufacturing facilities. Nymi Enterprise Edition enhances security, which leads to improved data integrity and thus allows an enterprise to meet its compliance mandate all while increasing productivity. Protected Data Integrity: Nymi Enterprise Edition is able to assure the integrity of the data being produced on the manufacturing floor through a combination of biometrics, on‚Äëbody detection, and strong industry-standard cryptography. Assured Compliance: Only the right employees can perform the right tasks, at the right times, for the right reasons. Nymi Enterprise Edition provides guaranteed data integrity that assures compliance with standards, such as FDA 21 CFR Part 11. Enhanced Security: A Nymi Band authenticates to a single assigned user, and only while they wear the band. Nymi Enterprise Edition provides easy traceability and non-repudiable electronic records, which makes simplier, less intrusive audits a reality. Increased Productivity: Secure, non-repudiable, wireless taps of the Nymi Band make cumbersome repetitive tasks, like typing passwords and paper signatures a thing of the past. Always On AuthenticationTM: Authentication is only required once at the beginning of a shift, completes in a matter of seconds, and persists until the operator removes the Nymi Band. Enterprise Ready: The back-end server and services required by Nymi Enterprise Edition are standard Microsoft products and are designed to be compatible with enterprise IT architecture. No modifications to Active Directory are required. Nymi provides a simple administrative interface for managing users and their Nymi Bands. Seamless Integrations: The Nymi SDK allows for integration with third-party software solutions, such as SSO, IAM, MES, and HMI. Deployment of the Nymi Enterprise Server at any site is seamless, quick, and easy, leveraging existing identity infrastructure. The Challenge:  Current enterprise authentication solutions are weak and broken. Usernames and passwords, smart cards, and PINs are all cumbersome, insecure authentication methods that are easily lost, shared, or stolen. An enterprise s most vital information is at constant risk of exploitation. Data integrity is questionable. Compliance concerns increase. Productivity diminishes. Costs rise.  Complex infrastructures like those on a manufacturing production line and tight controls make change prohibitive. Changing authentication solutions frequently entails weighing trade-offs between security and productivity, or implementing a solution that doesn t meet the compliance requirements set forth by governing bodies, thus risking fines and escalating costs.  Current Authentication Solutions = Weak Security = Questionable Data Integrity = Compliance Violations = Expensive Fines. Nymi realizes that changing authentication solutions cannot result in trade-offs between data integrity, security, compliance, and productivity. Each critical success factor goes hand-in-hand.  Nymi Enterprise Edition combines a highly secure, wearable device with an easily deployed enterprise software solution, to provide the world s strongest authentication solution to enterprises that are highly regulated, compliance driven, and place a high value on data integrity.  Nymi Enterprise Edition = Tighter Security = Assured Data Integrity = Simplified Compliance Audits = Improved Operational Efficiency. Nymi Enterprise Edition for Industrial IoT Applications: Pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries that deploy the Nymi authentication solution provide employees with a quick and easy way to achieve compliance and security standards without compromising productivity. Nymi Enterprise Edition is an industry-leading solution that makes audits simpler and less intrusive by ensuring uncompromised data integrity, traceability, and non-repudiation of a company s electronic records. Quality Statement  Nymi has implemented a Quality Management System (QMS) that aligns with our customer requirements and guides the development of products and solutions in compliance with GAMP5 (Good Automated Manufacturing Practice) guidelines by looking at the pharmaceutical manufacturing process as a whole. Nymi develops products and solutions with high traceability to ensure data integrity and security is maintained throughout the pharmaceutical manufacturing lifecycle.  To support our customer needs, we tailor our solutions to enable seamless integration and a structured qualification and validation approach which is in line with regulatory requirements and the GAMP5 recommendations. Additional documentation and guides are provided to support implementation and system validation into GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) environments to ensure pharmaceutical products are consistently produced, according to defined quality standards, every single time. Our Story: Assuring the human shouldn t be hard. It shouldn t be hard for you or your team, but it is. Today s solutions are incomplete and fall short of ensuring that you have the proper people performing the actions that the business intended. Weak passwords, shared credentials, and lost badges all challenge the integrity of data. Nymi builds security solutions that enable companies to be more secure, compliant and productive. Our solution allows employees to wear their credentials and authorize actions securely. Nymi currently works with the Top 100 companies in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing. Wondering how we got here?  Nymi was founded in 2011 in Toronto, Canada, based on research conducted at the University of Toronto. The research was focused on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and its unique properties. The ECG is different for each individual, and our founding team worked to use the heartbeat as a biometric identifier for authentication.  Initially, Nymi (Bionym at the time) was focused on licensing this technology to third-parties and OEMs to replace passwords in hardware devices. Over time, the team identified the need not just to improve or replace existing tools of authentication, but to create a completely new model of authentication: continuous, on-body authentication.  To bring this concept to market, it became necessary to develop dedicated authentication hardware. This served as the foundation of what was to become Nymi (December of 2014), and our enterprise authentication solution, Nymi Enterprise Edition.",,,,

Creating a Safe and Secure Society with High-Precision Facial Recognition Systems Using the world s highest level of facial recognition accuracy developed using deep learning technology to make security monitoring and management more efficient As use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly expands, a wide range of information is beginning to be linked together in diverse industries to make our lifestyles more convenient. At Panasonic, particularly in the field of security, deep learning technology using AI is integrated with intelligent camera technology and video monitoring software to advance the technical development and implementation of facial recognition systems. The World s Highest Level of Facial Recognition Accuracy Facial recognition systems can be effectively utilized in the field of security monitoring and management. Facial recognition can be applied to a variety of solutions: from identifying terrorists, suspicious persons, shoplifters and dangerous people, to expediting access to secure facilities. Panasonic has been engaged in the technical development of security camera systems for more than 60 years, constantly staying on top of the needs of those at the front lines of the field. Panasonic began R&D of image sensing technology close to 30 years ago, developed the LUMIX brand of digital cameras, and also started sales of facial recognition systems paired with our security cameras in 2011, thus accumulating a considerable track record and expertise in the field. Recently, as interest in the field of security has increased together with rapid changes in social conditions, in August 2018 Panasonic launched its high-precision facial recognition system ""FacePRO"" with deep learning technology, which combines security and image sensing technologies. The recognition engine of this system was developed together with the National University of Singapore ‚Äî one of Asia s leading academic institutes, which conducts cutting-edge research on deep learning technology. The system has been certified as the world s highest level of facial recognition performance*1 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a leading standards institute of the United States. *1 Having achieved the world s highest level of facial recognition performance, as certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States (as of April 2017) in a comparison test (IJB-A Face Verification Challenge Performance Report, IJB -A Face Identification Challenge Performance Report). Even with ""1:n"" Verification, High Recognition Accuracy Is Achieved There are two types of facial recognition: ""1:1"" (one to one) verification using one s face to match against a photo ID such as a passport; and ""1:n"" (one to many) verification which matches a target individual s face from within a number of unspecified people. The Panasonic facial recognition system uses a unique algorithm that combines a machine learning method based on deep learning and a similarity calculation method that suppresses errors. Even in the event of ""1:n"" verification, the facial features are extracted to greatly improve the recognition performance.*2 Highly precise verification can identify faces that are difficult to recognize with conventional technologies, including faces at an angle of up to 45 degrees to the left or right or 30 degrees up or down, and those partially hidden by a surgical mask or sunglasses. High-precision verification is also achieved with aging changes (recognizing faces that have changed over the years and with different hair styles). *2 Improves facial recognition performance by up to 500% compared to conventional systems. (Rejection rate reduced to 20% when the wrong person acceptance rate is set to 0.01 with the IJB-A face image dataset.) From Passive to Active Use: Preventing Incidents and Accidents Compared with conventional security systems, which are often just used to confirm events after they have occurred ‚Äî such as to use recorded images as evidence ‚Äî this system distinguishes the facial image of persons who require attention in advance. It can also be used to determine whether those persons are still present by conducting searches in real time. This allows users to actively prevent incidents and accidents, or leads to the quick discovery of such, all while helping to make security monitoring more efficient and increase safety and security. Reducing the Server and Network Loads With ordinary facial recognition systems, all of the captured images are sent to a server, and facial detection and recognition occurs within the server, which places all the data processing burden on the server. In addition, because a wide bandwidth is required to send the high volume of images, and a large-capacity hard disk drive (HDD) is needed to store them, the system typically tends to be large-scale. With FacePRO, the camera crops only the images (""Best Shot"") that are necessary for facial recognition from all the facial images recorded of the same person passing in front of a camera, and sends only those best shots to the server. As the camera bears part of the large image analysis processing load typically done by the server, and because only the images that are best suited to facial recognition are sent, there is less data transmission required by the network. This reduces the server load to approximately 1/5th that of a conventional system, and reduces the network load to approximately 1/10th. Compared to a conventional system that does not use this function, a 40-50% reduction in the overall system costs can be achieved. Integrated Management with an Existing System With Panasonic s ""i-PRO Monitoring System"" for instance, because integrated operation is possible with the existing system, the need to operate and manage a completely separate facial recognition system is eliminated, and the work can all be centralized in an integrated system. For example, when doing a target person search, which is an important part of a crime prevention monitoring system, by searching for a designated person, information on when and where that person appeared, which direction they were headed, and where the person presently is, can all be shown on a single monitoring screen in a timeline. The facial detection, facial verification, and tracking of captured images from the recorder are all done on one graphical user interface (GUI), enabling one-stop integrated management. This ability to provide each necessary component, from cameras to entire systems, is a strength offered only by Panasonic. Facial recognition systems not only streamline security monitoring and management work, but they can also be used for marketing applications. Panasonic participates in demonstration projects in a variety of fields and deploys products and systems for both consumer and enterprise use. Moving forward, we will continue to offer cutting-edge image technologies and integrated management as easy-to-use solutions to meet our customers  needs. Sustainability Initiatives: Environment, Society, Corporate Citizenship Activities. Facial Recognition: FacePRO:Panasonic Facial Recognition System. Panasonic FacePRO can identify faces that are difficult to recognize within common video surveillance technology. These situations include reading faces at an angle of up to 45 degrees to the left or right or 30 degrees up or down, with a 90% accuracy rate when detecting faces partially hidden by sunglasses or face masks. FacePRO also has high accuracy reads in matching faces taken from up to ten-year-old passport images. -Specific faces can be registered in advance to send an alarm when they are detected. The faces of repeat shoplifters and wanted criminals,etc. can be registered in the facial recognition security/surveillance system from data recorded in the past. Information can also be shared between facial recognition systems by importing generic photo data in the JPEG format, etc. Alarms can notify the operator by displaying pop-ups on the screen, emitting warning sounds, or flashing the camera on the map, etc. -Face images can be used to perform searches. For example, face images of suspicious people detected on the sales floor can be searched to track information on a timeline, including what time they entered the store and which sales floor they passed. Whether suspicious people have shoplifted, etc. after entering the store can also be immediately searched for and checked by the facial recognition security/surveillance system ""FacePRO"". Case Study - Since October 18, 2017, three units of Panasonic s facial recognition gate have been put into operation at Tokyo International Airport s immigration control. Without the need for prior registration of biometric data, the system compares photographic data of the traveler s face in the IC chip embedded in the person s passport with a photo taken at the facial recognition gate to verify the identity. - Jumbo Ten Brink Food Stores in the Netherlands installed Panasonic security cameras and a facial recognition server as part of their commitment to their  zero tolerance shoplifting policy.  - Avid football fans gather at stadiums across Europe, but sometimes that enthusiasm can turn to dangerous behavior. See how Panasonic s facial recognition system helps to solve this problem. FacePRO Main Features: Face Matching Registered Face Detection, One of the major advantages of the Facial Recognition Solution is the level of control it gives you from a central point of management. Thanks to the direct connection between camera and server, you can control and gather insight from up to 20 remote cameras from one server, at the same time. With face matching and visual analysis carried out by the system in real time, your operator can easily access any recorded images related to that face or customer, via the GUI in their monitoring software. - When it is matched with registered people, alarm of face matching is output in real-time, and display an alarm history in the list. - Specified screen image can be played back on control monitor with double-clicking on an alarm history. Unregistered Face Detection (New Feature): Real-time detection of people who are NOT registered. -The Facial Recognition Server Software(Ver2.0 or later) shall set registered face detection or unregistered face detection* in a facial recognition server. *Unregistered face detection setting can be used both of Unregistered Face Detection and Registered Face Detection simultaneously - The Facial Recognition Server Software in unregistered face detection setting shall connect up to 10 Panasonic i-PRO cameras with best shot function to a single server depends on the number of people passing and the retention period of the face image. - Facial Recognition Server Software in unregistered face detection setting shall be performed detection of unregistered face at three seconds collates with 30,000 registered faces after receiving the face thumbnail to facial recognition server. Face Search The facial recognition software runs silently in your system, collecting data on each face that it detects; this data is then stored within an easily accessible database. A user will then be able to access this database, and will be given the option to select a particular face. With this functionality, the user can choose to set an alarm to be sounded upon future detection of this subject, or simply track a particular person s movements in chronological order throughout all of the cameras in the system. - Face images that camera detected are stored, and it can be searched later. - By searching the face DB, you can display the result of each cameras in chronological order and find movement locus of persons. - Specify camera or date in detected face images and display the result in the list in similarity order. Face Registration Up to 30,000. People Counting, Age and Gender Statistics The software also features an analytics section. In this area, a user is given the ability to analyse statistics such as people counting, and also allows them to detect age and gender. The system will then display the relevant information in an accessible manner. - Count people of detected face and evaluate their age and gender. - Display the result on the screen with statistical graph. - The statistical data can be saved as a CSV file for analytical use. Benefit: High Precision - The deep learning technology used in the new software was jointly developed with the National University of Singapore and improves facial recognition performance by up to 500% compared to conventional systems. - A unique algorithm that combines deep learning, a machine learning method, with a similarity calculation method that suppresses errors, enables recognition in situations that were difficult with conventional facial recognition technology, such as when the face is angled (up to 45 degrees to the left or right or 30 degrees up or down), partially hidden with sunglasses or a surgical mask, or changed by aging. The camera automatically detects the moving objects, movement speed, faces, and light intensity (day/night/headlights) found in video that are usually hard to see due to subject movement and backlight, and optimizes the settings in real-time and capture more optimal video of the subject. - The Best Shot License Key included with this software can be installed on Panasonic i-PRO EXTREME series network cameras (sold separately) to automatically select the images suitable for facial recognition from the multiple face images captured when a person passes in front of the camera, and send only those selected images to the server. This enables high-quality images suitable for facial recognition to be sent without putting a load on the server. System Cost Reduction: - With conventional facial recognition systems, all captured images are sent to the server, and the server performs face detection and facial recognition, which concentrates the load of data processing on the server. Systems also tend to be large-scale because of the large bandwidth required to send all the images and the high capacity hard drive space required to save those images. - Using Panasonic s system that combines this product with cameras that include the iA function allows faces to be detected by the camera and only the Best Shot images that contain faces to be sent to the server, which dramatically decreases network load and eliminates the need for large bandwidth. Performing facial recognition on the server using the Best Shot images reduces server load and hard drive capacity requirements as well as permitting up to 20*6 network cameras to be connected to a single server. - With this Panasonic system, it is no longer necessary to send the data-intensive high resolution images to a server, unlike conventional systems. This delivers high-precision facial recognition while dramatically decreasing network traffic, transmission costs, and network construction costs. - When using Panasonic s system with 10 or more network cameras connected, costs can be reduced by about 40 to 50% compared to conventional systems that do not use the Best Shot function. System Expandability: Simple batch registration of a maximum of 10,000 faces is possible with the standard Facial Recognition Server Software (WV-ASF950). The optional Face Registration Expansion Kit (WV-ASFE951W) enables registration of up to 30,000 faces at large-scale facilities. Integrated management with i-PRO video surveillance system Face detection, facial recognition, and tracking with recorded video can be performed in the same GUI by performing integrated management with the WV-ASM300 or WV-ASE231W client software for Panasonic i-PRO video surveillance systems. This eliminates the need for the dedicated operation and management required for conventional facial recognition systems and enables work to be centralized.",,,,

German Standards. What is Passbase? Passbase is a suite of customizable user identification tools including liveness detection, document authentication, facial recognition, and more. These tools are combined to estimate the authenticity of a User s Identity shared with you. Empower the World with a Digital Identity System. Our goal is to empower the world with a digital identity system that puts individual privacy and data security first. Our identity system allows for a more secure, private, and convenient digital world. Privacy: We empower people by giving them control of their sensitive information and, in turn, allow our partners to effortlessly identify users and comply with modern privacy standards. Trust: We provide our partners and their users with delightful to use identity products, that enable people of all backgrounds to safely trust and transact with each other. Security: We are building a future where data breaches impacting the sovereignty of our identities are a thing of the past, by providing users with tools to securely share identity information with others. Meet the team: A group of creative technologists working together to solve open identity. Our Vision. Over the past ten years, there has been a massive erosion of personal privacy and data security. More than 6.2 billion consumer data points have been stolen in the United States and many of those data points represent details related to your identity. Usernames, passwords and social security numbers, to name a few. This is simply unacceptable and we believe it s time to give you back control over what is rightfully yours. Your identity information. Our goal is to empower the world with a digital identity system that puts individual privacy and data security first. This means giving individuals the power to decide with whom they share their personal information, and in turn, allow businesses to be certain about the identity of the people utilizing their services without collecting massive amounts of information about them. Our identity system allows for a more secure, private, and convenient digital world. This is why our team works tirelessly to build a world-class identity proofing solution that puts the individual back in control. From here, we will reimagine the future of identity, privacy, and security online through the combination of cutting-edge technologies driven by a world-class team, hungry for change. Our beliefs - Five things we believe to be true. 1 Identity is a huge problem. We believe that most sensitive identity information online is collected, stored, and lost because businesses need to verify the identity of people using their services. They do this in order to build trust with and between their users. This has caused a boom in the number of data breaches containing personal data and in turn an erosion of personal security and privacy. 2 Privacy is the future. We believe privacy and data ownership are important now, and will become increasingly more important, as more sensitive aspects of our lives shift online. This trend has accelerated with this mass adoption of mobile computing, the advent of IoT, and the digitization of the old economy. 3 Technology can solve it. We believe the technologies required to solve identity online while maintaining user privacy, now exist and can be combined into a valuable solution for businesses, consumers, and governments. We have the team, tools, and determination to combine these technologies into a solution that ensures data security and privacy for both business and consumers. 4 Big tech won t win. We believe the technology giants are NOT in a position to solve this problem. Many of their businesses are premised on collecting & monetizing personal data or mass distributing hardware. These ulterior motives make them poor candidates to solve identity and we believe it will take a new kind of company to pioneer this redistribution of power and data ownership. 5 This is a rebellion. We believe the world unconsciously sacrificed individual liberties and took on massive risk for the sake of convenient and personalized services. We are the team that will spark and lead a rebellion to resolve this. By building a foundation upon which others can build secure and convenient services, we will silently return the power and control back to people and unlock opportunities for new types of businesses that could never have existed before. Our Values - Our values and how we uphold them: These are the fundamental principles by which we live, work, and grow as a team. 1 Personal Ownership What this means to us We are all leaders and are empowered to make decisions. When things don t go the way we planned, we own it, understand it, and keep moving forward, stronger as one team. 2 Persistent Learning What this means to us We are more interested in learning than being right and believe no idea is too sacred to be questioned. We deeply value giving and receiving feedback, no matter rank or title. We leave it all on the dance floor. 3 Product Excellence What this means to us We craft experiences people remember and love. We aim to create products that integrate into daily life, changing it for the better. We are building something very powerful and with great power, comes great responsibility. 4 Power of Community What this means to us We make it a point to build an organization that is a reflection of the world, and not ourselves. We celebrate our differences and promise to always invest in each other s long term success and happiness.",,,,

SINA - For the Highest IT Security Requirements One of the centrepieces of the secunet portfolio is SINA (Secure Inter-Network Architecture), a high-security solution that secunet developed on behalf of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). SINA is mainly used by clients of secunet s Public Authorities, Homeland Security and Defence divisions, and has taken on an increasingly important role in the Critical Infrastructures division. SINA products are used for the secure processing, storage, transmission and verification of classified and other sensitive information. The system works by strictly separating differently classified data. SINA solutions are scalable, designed for complex national, international and multinational infrastructures, and suitable formass roll-outs. The extensive product range - from tablets and other clients, through crypto gateways to Ethernet encoders - can be deployed in a wide range of application scenarios. Thanks to SINA Management, the individual SINA components can be flexibly configured, allowing the customer to retain sovereignty over cryptography and key management at all times. SINA is the only IP-based cryptographic system that is approved by the German Federal Office for Information Security up to security classification German SECRET, as well as for the international NATO SECRET and SECRET UE/EU SECRET levels. National and international authorities, the armed forces, and private companies which are subject to the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy s secret protection programme have successfully used SINA for many years. With nearly 100,000 installations in over 30 countries worldwide, the numbers speak for themselves. PKI: Public-Key-Infrastructures. secunet security infrastructure ‚Äì crucial for critical networks An ecosystem for secure networking and separation of critical networks. The aim is to isolate separated networks across sites and connect them to the ""outside world"" ‚Äì manufacturers, service providers, project partners ‚Äì via secure gateways and quarantine systems. At the same time, the established perimeter and protection devices in the network can be monitored intelligently and automatically in real time. The services provided by the secunet security infrastructure are based on generally applicable technical security architectures that are universally implemented in various industries. Both classic IT and industrial networks are served with appropriate individual characteristics. Biometrics: secunet is among the leading biometrics experts not only in Germany. For us, biometrics is far from being just another trending topic. Instead, we have been significantly involved in the successful implementation of biometric key projects in Europe for almost 20 years. We deal with the biometric registration and verification in the context of official identity documents as well as for the identity check and verification of persons, border control and passenger flow optimisation - from research, evaluation, piloting and product development to realisation. We are profoundly versatile when it comes to biometrics: Investments in long-term partnerships Cooperation on technical guidelines and standards Standard-compliant IT solutions and products Comprehensive consulting for future-proof solutions Research with consistent practical relevance. In close cooperation with the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), we develop standard-compliant products and IT solutions which have been internationally recognised as reference implementation. For example, the secunet biomiddle platform: As core component of many eID and biometrics applications, the middleware, takes over the flexible integration of the application-specific processes and controls the required software and hardware components via standard interfaces. secunet continuously supports and impacts the newest developments and technologies through an extensive network and active participation in international work groups. Our experts have contributed to over 50 technical guidelines and ISO standards in the area of biometrics and eIDs. As part of a transatlantic team, we are currently refining the NFIQ2 algorithm for the assessment of the quality of fingerprints.  Our holistic, standard-compliant products and IT solutions are used thousands of times every day. They simplify the registration and verification process of electronic and biometric identities and ensure the highest degree of security. We advise our customers about suitable and future-proof biometric modalities and protection mechanisms as well as about measures for handling sensitive biometric data. In doing so, we ensure that processes and solutions are aligned with the respective legal framework conditions, for example regarding data protection, and that such conditions are observed. Our experts continuously research even more secure processes for practical use. We deal with current, relevant questions: How must biometric algorithms and processes be designed so that the registered data do not allow for conclusions about a single person - even if the data should fall into unauthorised hands? Or how can we use artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning for anomaly detection and thereby increase the security of biometric systems against fraud?  Biometrics and eID Solutions by secunet: make any application modular and highly secure are always of high quality ""made in Germany"" guarantee low total cost of ownership are consistantly standard-compliant, hence flexible in use and globally interoperable always contain the latest insights from standardisation bodies. Secure IT-Infrastructure IT security is the backbone of every modern society. Anyone who does not know if their data and IT systems are adequately protected is playing a risky game. Secure IT infrastructures and workplaces, sophisticated security concepts, and clear-cut emergency plans are now vital prerequisites for all organisations, whether local or global. As a result, the IT security market is as varied and dynamic as its challenges. Over the last two decades, secunet has emerged as an innovative market leader in Germany and Europe, offering trusted, high-quality solutions and products in fields like applied cryptography, e-Government, business security and automotive security, all of which are designed to meet the complex challenges of today and tomorrow. Our services range from analysis and consulting, to the conception, development and integration of software and hardware solutions, as well as training and support. Protection against Cyberattacks Modern technological developments and diverse aspects of digitization - such as connected vehicles, smart metering, remote control of building services, Industry 4.0, global financial transactions, artificial intelligence - provide a platform for industrial espionage and sabotage. Today, cyberattacks target in particular Critical Infrastructure Operators as well as organizations with sovereign functions, which must ensure the internal security and the defense of a country and protect the identities and rights of citizens. In relation to its numerous national and international customers, secunet relies on long-term partnerships. The security partnership with the Federal Republic of Germany since 2004 underlines this impressively. The Divisions: Public Authorities, Defense, Homeland Security, Critical Infrastructures, Automotive. The secunet Public Procurement Division supports and advises state, federal and EU organizations, using state-of-the-art products and services as well as individual security solutions that can be combined as needed. These meet the requirements of a modern administration, enable the fulfillment of sovereign tasks and comply with the security requirements for the protection of classified Information as well as other legal requirements. The armed forces, military authorities and organisations have a particularly strong need to protect the confidentiality of their data. Their spectrum ranges from national and international to mission-related classified data. Intelligent IT security architectures are crucial for efficient, needs-based provision and processing of this data. This applies in particular to the basic IT-based troop operations, military command information systems, vehicle and on-board networks as well as multinational mission networks with mobile tactical system components. Based on longterm well-established domain knowledge and experiences in customer-specific requirements, the Defence Division of secunet supports military customers - focusing on encryption and cyber security - conceptual and with system integration, as well as with application-based research & development services. The Division Homeland Security is specialized in meeting the needs of the organizations and relevant ministries involved in this context, delivering tailor-made, holistic and intelligent IT security solutions - nationally and internationally.

Critical infrastructures are organisations and institutions that are crucial to our society. These infrastructures are increasingly reliant on IT-supported systems and require special protection, because malfunction and disruption can have dramatic consequences for the German and European economies and society at large. It is therefore vitally important to protect CRITIS from cyber attacks, espionage and sabotage. What s more, the division s extensive consulting and product portfolio allows customers to prevent and counteract malfunctions and security breaches - while meeting all applicable legal requirements and industry standards. The automotive industry wants solutions suitable for series production that respond to vehicle-specific needs, as well as to the peculiarities of the entire automotive supply chain.

Government authorities of other EU states such as the Czech Republic, Norway, Iceland and Austria as well as international organisations also rely on the state-of-the-art and highly secure solutions that secunet develops. Authentication: Secure Authentication - Essential in the Digital World Secure authentication is essential in the digital world. Applications, systems and infrastructures require proof that the person interacting with them is actually who they say they are. Hence administering users, identities and their authentication attributes is a subject of increasing significance in the electronic world. Border Control: For Secure, Efficient and Future-Proof Air, Land and Sea Borders Modern border control systems, innovative technologies, such as biometrics ""on the move"", and large-scale inter-connected information systems have paved the way for fully automated border control: Thanks to nearly complete process transparency and simplification as well as intuitive user guidance concepts, travellers already pass through the border control process independently and with minimal interaction. The growing amount of passenger numbers and increasingly complex security requirements for border control systems remain to be a challenge for efficient and comfortable processing of travellers.

WE ARE FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS: Our customers deal with a multitude of issues and face extremely complicated tasks each and every day, especially when it comes to the safety and security of their employees, customers and facilities. These environments leave no room for error and require utmost efficacy, razor sharp precision, and not to mention, consistency. With the flip of a switch, we provide all that and more. Simlart gives everyone the tools they need and the trust they expect to know that everything simply works as it is supposed to. We do this by linking everything back to detection, identification and verification of faces and objects through biometric facial recognition technology, which provides certainty that the information being received is indicative of the actions being performed in front of the camera. Our technology helps our customers manage and monitor the activities of the persons they are responsible for and ensures that every single one is safe and secure, while the organization stays informed and in control at all times. OVERVIEW Smilart s facial recognition technology (FRT) can be divided into three main applications: detection, identification and verification. DETECTION IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION. Our solution is currently the fastest on the market and the sensitivity of our technology is also adjustable to particular functions depending on what a client s ultimate purpose for having this system is, thus it is multifunctional at the flip of a proverbial switch. DETECTION Detection works by utilizing our patented algorithm which processes incoming camera images and then determines on a mathematical level if this received information is indicative of a human face or not, in just a few milliseconds. ARE YOU HUMAN? Detection can best be described as the biometric answer to either the question, ""Is that an image of a human face,"" or to, ""Is that an object?"" When an image is introduced to the system in detection mode, our software can instantaneously, within a few milliseconds and with 100% accuracy, determine if that image is in fact that of a human face or of some non-human object. What s more, Smilart FRT can be used in detection mode to identify if, for instance, a seat belt is being worn or what the characteristics of a license plate are, as well as determine if an online subscriber is uploading an image of a human face to their profile, and so on. The possibilities are vast. APPLICATIONS: STADIUM - Keep an accurate head count of the number of visitors to sporting events; crowd control, etc. VENUES - Tally customers to entertainment, hospitality, social and business events. ONLINE SERVICES - Many dating sites and other social networking and services sites must determine if subscribers are uploading actual photos. RETAILERS - Retailers often require accurate customer counts for data analytics and we provide that accuracy. LEFT ITEMS - Airports, public areas and other places that are either vulnerable to security threats or where people can accidentally forget belongings, can be scanned for left behind objects. MOTER VEHICLE SAFETY - Assists law enforcement to more precisely detect if passengers are wearing their seat belts. TRAFFIC SAFETY - Scan for license plates, broken wind shields, tinted windows, etc. IMMIGRATION - Everything from passport scanning to immigration security to duplicate application detection. SOCIAL NETWORKS - Face tagging. DETECT THE POSSIBILITIES From law enforcement to image scanning, from photo IDs to bank cards, Smilart detection solutions are your go-to source for high-tech, high value, low cost solutions. Our platform is adaptable to almost any convenience or task. If you think that biometric detection may help you but have questions, contact us now to learn how you can benefit. IDENTIFICATION Identification works by utilizing a subsequent patented in-house algorithm which processes an image or images as they come in and converts them to mathematical models we call faceprints. It then searches through a database of previously enrolled faceprints until it can find a match. This process takes 30 milliseconds ‚Äì the fastest in the world! WHO ARE YOU? To help clarify identification, it is the biometric answer to the question, ""Who is this person?"" When an image is introduced to the system in identification mode, whether that image is provided voluntarily, for example when entering or exiting a premises through a controlled passageway, or involuntarily, for instance when a camera is scanning a public place with numerous individuals, our software can instantaneously, within 30 milliseconds, determine if that image is in fact that of an individual who is enrolled into a preexisting database and then confirm if there is a match. What s more, our identification solutions can robustly identify people and have proven to be resistant to occlusions, aging, pose and even glasses. Smilart FRT identification technology can be used in an almost unlimited variety of ways and industries and is custom tailored to each customer s special requirements; therefore, the range of applications is enormous. FEATURES FAST High optimization Uses GPU for lightning speed processing 30 milliseconds per search ‚Äì fastest in the world! FLEXIBLE Client specific installation instead of one size fits all Scalable architecture Adjustable to specific task or purpose at the flip of a switch RELIABLE Impeccable and unrivaled accuracy 100% secure Very high redundancy ORIGINAL 100% in-house developed platform, coding, patents, and algorithm (true vendor) No additional license payments to outside vendors VALUE Competitively priced Superior product - best on the market.

Our platform is adaptable to almost any convenience or task. If you think that biometric identification may help you but have some questions, contact us now to learn how you can benefit. VERIFICATION Finally, verification works when an incoming image asserts that it has a previously enrolled faceprint in the database and requests confirmation of this, where then the software pulls that alleged print from the database and then decides if it in fact does or does not match the new image. IS THAT REALLY YOU? Verification is just that. Our platform realizes if an individual is or is not who they say they are. To best visualize the process, verification is the biometric answer to, ""System: this is who I am. Can you please verify that?"" When an image is introduced to the system in verification mode, an individual enrolled in the organization s database may ask the system to confirm whether or not he or she is in fact that particular individual in order to, for instance, gain access to an entrance, a post office or bank safe deposit box, a secure area, an online exam website, or any number of other permissions. Very often verification is used as a secondary security feature in tandem with some other access mechanism such as a keycard, a fingerprint, a biometric scan, or any number of other access devices or mechanisms. Say an employee wants access to a facility or a gym member wants to enter a fitness center. That individual may swipe their card and as an authenticity safeguard will be asked to look into a camera. The swipe of the card notifies the system that person X wants access. The system than searches through its database for person X s preexisting faceprint and matches it to the fresh image. If they match then access is granted, if not, it is denied. Besides office buildings and other facilities that require basic security, verification is particularly valuable to organizations with high employee turnover rates, sensitive security issues, and those that incur losses from lost or stolen access items such as keycards, or from forbidden manipulation of those same types of access mechanisms. When the wrong person is in possession of an access device or has found a way to trick an outdated access system, it can at best become a costly situation and at worst, a serious threat. In scenarios where security is of major importance such as in a correctional facility, verification is a surefire way to permanently close the breach. Research has proven that even fingerprints are not 100% distinctive as previously thought. Smilart FRT verification can be used in a number of different ways depending on each customer s unique demands. The applications are limitless! APPLICATIONS: Online education - Make sure your distance learning students are the ones taking the exams. Military - Secure your base or facility from intrusion, grant or deny access based on authorization, modern equipment can be set to work for the rightful owner only. Detention, Penal & correctional - Control who goes in and out, inmate verification, inmate processing. Banking - Authorized card and account holders, access to vaults and other secure areas, access to safe deposit boxes. Post office - Access to rightful P.O. Box customers, employee access management. Online services - Accept/deny online applications or visa applications, stop credit card fraud, verify age, renew IDs or credit cards or subscriptions, monitor online gaming, etc. Law enforcement - Verify identity of suspects as well as gender and ethnicity, criminal database processing at the station or in the streets, arrest processing, serve warrants accurately, confirm registrations and ownership. Property & facility management - Employee access, member authorization, security passage, school safety and access (government buildings, plants, factories).

HOW WE GOT HERE Smilart was founded in 2005 when two entrepreneurs with backgrounds in banking and computer gaming met two scientists specializing in visual object processing. Together they decided to form Smilart. The first result of their collaboration was an online photo editor, which was extremely effective in removing the infamous  red eye  effect from pictures, a necessary demand at that time. Other products soon followed, effectively establishing the company as a major player in the market for visual processing. Smilart then attracted the attention of a major investment firm whose focus was the high-tech industry. Having quickly secured the necessary financing Smilart began developing new projects.The Smilart platform is a technology stack which uses facial recognition algorithms to reliably identify humans in cooperative and uncooperative real-time scenarios. Our advanced algorithms are a culmination of years of research in the fields of computer vision, digital signal processing and machine learning. They can precisely identify people (as well as objects) and have proven to be resistant to occlusions, aging, pose and even glasses. Smilart is currently used in numerous production and development projects and by private organizations and government agencies alike.",https://www.smilart.com/,219,2.01E+13,2.03E+13

Track helper s location throughout the task. View photos of work. TaskAssure monitors tasks and keeps you informed. What is TaskAssure? Patent-pending TaskAssure is actually a simple idea: you create task assignments for your helpers, which are sent to their TaskAssure mobile phone app. When a helper performs a task we use sensors in their smartphones to verify activities, and keep you informed about progress. TaskAssure is for services, what tracking is for shipping. Trust but Verify - Any Service, Any Time, Any Place! These days, a background check is not good enough. Trust, but verify with TaskAssure. Our Mission: Since our founding in 2012, TaskAssure has sought to find ever better ways to help people keep informed about services they need when they won t be there to watch. While we were originally inspired by the needs of families with eldercare and other long term care challenges (see our story ), we are finding applications in many situations including property management, child care, pet care, and a variety of services such as housekeeping, transportation, lawn care, and construction.

If you are currently using your talents to provide services to others, consider the advantage offering TaskAssure as part of your service. More people will choose you rather than your competitor if they know they can receive verified updates about tasks they assign you. If you are a services business, consider how much better you can manage your team if you are receiving real time notification of task activities from TaskAssure. With TaskAssure you would also have the option to allow your clients to receive updates.

931,Tech5,Switzerland,2018,Private,1,0,1,1,0,0,https://tech5.ai/,https://tech5.ai/,,"A TECHNOLOGIES FOR INCLUSION COMPANY. TECH5 BIOMETRIC MODALITIES. FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION The use of Fingerprint to establish or confirm a person s identity is among the oldest biometric techniques used in the world. This type of recognition relies on taking an image of an individual s fingerprint and comparing it to a single image of that fingerprint or one stored in a database of images. The ability to implement this technology to unlock smart phones, log in to computers or gain access to physically secure environments has made it hugely popular. IRIS RECOGNITION Iris Recognition is generally considered one of the most accurate and reliable biometric modalities because it capitalizes on the uniqueness and stability of the colored portion of the eye, which can be seen even from a distance. First patented in 1987, iris recognition is now widely used in National Identification programs as well as for personal identity confirmation. FACE RECOGNITION Face Recognition is fast becoming the most popular biometric technology thanks to significant improvements in accuracy afforded by Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Neural Networks). It is now possible to obtain excellent matching accuracy even with variations due to aging, lighting conditions, expression, and even extreme pose. These features make face recognition highly suitable for forensic applications, ID solutions and mobile authentication. TECH5 FACE RECOGNITION: FAST AND ACCURATE IN VERY LARGE DATABASES The high-speed and extremely accurate TECH5 face recognition technology has proven its efficiency in real-world projects that work with national databases consisting of hundreds of millions of faces and capable of processing millions of operations in real-time. Our face recognition technology is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the most up to date architecture and progressive methods of training that permit the highest accuracy for both identification (1:N match) and verification (1:1 match). Our face recognition technology has been trained on diverse databases, and as such, the algorithm remains invariant across different nations, ages and genders, showing high accuracy not only for Asians, Europeans and Africans, but also for different nations within these continents. TECH5 FACE RECOGNITION DRIVES THE FOLLOWING USE CASES:  ID MANAGEMENT Real-time verification and identification against millions of records in an enrollment database ÓÉØ CITY SURVEILLANCE Online face recognition using regular CCTV camera feeds deployed in Safe Cities projects IMMIGRATION AND PASSPORT CONTROL Reliable identity verification for fast border crossing and entry prevention of unwanted visitors FACE FORENSICS Fast search of suspects identified in video records. Rapid identification of suspects and victims in field-forensic applications Óòç ACCESS CONTROL Secure, accurate and user-friendly access control and time attendance PRISON MANAGEMENT Fast ID checking of prisoners as well as visitors. ADVANTAGES & BENEFITS: RECOGNIZABLE, EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE IT YOURSELF Subjects in any position can be recognized, despite angles and turns, facial expressions, glasses, occlusions or even gender transformations. The image can be obtained from any source including, but not limited to, an ID photo, selfie, CCTV feed or social network image. CROSS-PLATFORM SOFTWARE AND COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF (COTS) HARDWARE: No risk of getting locked into expensive or specialized hardware and software. You can run TECH5 face recognition on high-speed GPU, standard CPU and mobile ARM platforms. Choose between Linux, Windows, Android or iOS. HIGH SPEED AND PERFORMANCE: Our high-speed processing saves you money on buying hardware. We process up to 150 images in real time using one GPU and search against a database of 100M images in 1 second with a single CPU. SECURITY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION: Protect your data from misuse or tampering. All biometric data is transferred as encrypted templates, which are irreversible and can be used on Android or iOS. AGE AND GENDER: Do you want to know your customers or audience? Add more analytics to your face recognition. Our advanced algorithms can classify faces by age, gender, race and nation. ANTI-SPOOFING: Protect your users from tampering. Advanced liveness detection algorithms seamlessly prevent unauthorized access by using printed or displayed images, video, and masks.

Automated Biometric Identification System: The efficacy of an identity management solution depends on the reliability and integrity of its database. It is thus crucial that there should be no duplicate records in the system. This is achieved by various biometric identifiers that correspond to a person uniquely. Quantifiable biometric characteristics include fingerprint, face, iris and palm print. Often multi-modal biometrics are used to enhance the integrity of a system. Automated Fingerprint Identification System The most common biometric used in automated identification is the fingerprint. Automated Fingerprint Identification System, TigerAFIS, is certified by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Its speed and accuracy of its proprietary fingerprint matching technique makes it suitable for very large scale (millions records) de-duplications. Tiger AFIS is currently used for a total of over 500million records with an average of 500,000 transactions performed daily all over the world. Ranked  1 in NIST MINEX 2009 Ranked among top 3 in NIST PFT Tests in US POE / POEBVA Datasets Ranked  1 for Lowest EER in FVC-OnGoing (as of Aug  11) Accuracy of 99.9% for two fingers Latent Fingerprint/Palm print Tiger AFIS technology allows law enforcement agencies to obtain and store latent print images from a variety of sources including scanners, high resolution digital cameras, and industry standard digital image formats. Its latent print image enhancement tool which simplifies verification and editing process including finger/palm print rotation, image reversal, contrast/brightness adjustments and comprehensive search and review. The image enhancement tool can load ten print card Detect the ROI of the fingerprints and user can manually correct the ROI if needed The minutiae are automatically detected Matched image can be showed side by side for manual examination Similarly palm print can be enhanced, search and examined. It supports partial palm print. Our implemented technology to create WSQ images for fingerprint meets FBI and NIST accuracy requirements as specified in WSQ Gray-Scale Fingerprint Image Compression Specification Version 3.1. It matches the criteria for 500ppi grayscale image, 8 bits per pixel (256) at 5:1 and 15:1 target compression ratios. This enables our clients to be sure they are getting a top-tier WSQ solution. Face Recognition System With detection accuracy nearly 100%, TigerIT  s proprietary face matching technique is used for both verification (1:1) and identification (1:N). Its adjustable learning based Matching System is aided by robust facial feature localization that extracts facial features in different illumination and environmental conditions and generates an optimal face template. Fast enrolling speed ‚Äì 10 enrollments per core-second Ultra-fast matching speed ‚Äì 3,000,000 matches per core-second Matching accuracy ~0.37% at FAR 0.001 for ICAO standardized images ~1.27% at FAR 0.001 for any recognized frontal face databases (Non ICAO standard) Support for recognized image formats including JPEG2000 format Field adjustable image resolution support Iris Integration We can integrate Iris capture and matching algorithms to support Robust iris detection Automatic interlacing detection and correction Correct iris segmentation Standard Compatibility - ISO 19794-6(2005, 2010) Adjudication Adjudication is the process to determine if a hit in the AFIS is in fact a real or a false match. It assists operators by showing all biometrics on screen (side-by-side as shown below), zoomed to help in the comparison process and also all scores in a multi-modal matching system. The adjudication workflow options include the ability to randomly assign a hit result to an adjudicator (given multiple adjudicators exist in the enterprise), and to have more than one adjudicator review each hit result (again this can be randomly assigned to the second adjudicator to prevent any collusion). In addition, an ""Investigate"" state can be instantiated to enable a committee or assigned investigator to review the file in much more detail and scrutiny, including possibly calling the person back in for an interview. TgerIT Adjudicate enables identity adjudicators to review the match results from TigerAFIS as well as potentially disqualifying information from 3rd party authoritative sources (e.g. police record).

Usually application forms are for New registrations Renewal Replacement of damaged or lost passports. Once complete with validation checks passed, the applicant is able to print the form for later submission. The form will contain a unique ID number in digits as well as barcode. This number will be used by the data entry officials to identify the applicant from the database. This saves enrollment operators time to enter data and also minimizes errors by the data entry operator. Digitization Module Often government and other running agencies have filled paper application forms for existing users that need to be imported into the electronic system to avoid data duplication and reduce data collection overhead. The Digitization Module provides tools for extracting text data using Optical Character Recognition,as well as fingerprint and photo from scanning the pre-filled paper forms. The data entry component for the scanned documents supports cascade view of scanned form and extracted data, as well as vetting of multiple entries of same form (by multiple data entry operator, at times done to reduce data entry errors). Fingerprint extraction comes with image segmentation to reduce noise, WSQ compression meeting WSQ Gray-Scale Fingerprint Image Compression Specification Version 3.1 and image quality score for each fingerprint recorded, based on ISO 29794-4 standard. The photo extraction tool ensures ICAO Full Frontal Image requirements (ISO/IEC FCD 19794-5) based on eyes and mouth detection and incorporates intelligent photo cropping to meet target quality benchmark. Proofing after Enrollment A key step after enrollment is to verify the authenticity and uniqueness of the entry. The proofing tool helps the vetting of the applicant by searching for relevant data in external sources. Finally, qualified specialists in the registration team review and adjudicate all of the proofing and vetting results. The process can be done in batch or individually, depending on the type of credential and the local laws and policies and authoritative sources. For example, ICAO and leading passport agency best-practices and policies encourage that a passport applicant s claimed citizenship status and identity be verified by a minimum of one, and preferably two or more, authoritative sources such as other government agencies that register and issue reference credentials such as birth certificates, driver licenses national ID cards, voter registration ID cards, etc. Furthermore, any available criminal history and behavior checks can be leveraged to determine if the applicant may have been involved in criminal, terrorist, or counterfeiting activities in the past that may prevent them from receiving an admission. For example, a variety of text-based databases are hosted and maintained by Interpol that are available to deliver criminal, terrorist and counterfeiter query results to an adjudication officer to help establish a risk level for each applicant.

EXPLORE OUR PRODUCTS. Facial ID Verification: What is Facial ID Verification? Facial ID Verification is an innovative new cloud-based service from TOC Biometrics which allows organisations ‚Äì both commercial and governmental ‚Äì to verify a customer s identity just by scanning their official identity documents. National identity cards Driver s licenses Passports Powerful facial recognition algorithms match the individual with the photo ID and intelligent liveness detection functionality ensures that a real person is present. Here s how it works Facial ID Verification from TOC Biometrics provides the most accurate biometric authentication available today and can be accessed quickly and easily via our cloud API ‚Äì using the latest Representational State Transfer (REST) technology ‚Äì to transform a range of business processes. Onboarding Remote approvals Know Your Customer (KYC). Digital Signature: What is Digital Signature? Digital Signature is an innovative new cloud-based service from TOC Biometrics which allows organisations ‚Äì both commercial and governmental ‚Äì to incorporate simple electronic signatures into their PDF documents. As a key part of the TOC ID Verification system ‚Äì utilising advanced facial and fingerprint biometrics and public key infrastructure (PKI) technology ‚Äì the Digital Signature tool brings together the documentation to be signed and the personal authentication information required to ensure approval and acceptance of the relevant commercial and legal terms. Here s how it works Digital Signature from TOC Biometrics provides highly validated Remote Approvals and can be integrated into existing systems quickly and easily. Through a secure communication to our cloud API ‚Äì using the latest Representational State Transfer (REST) technology ‚Äì documents are digitally signed and a  cryptographic stamp  certificate is issued. This smart identity validation and document approval solution can help to streamline complex workflows and business-critical customer journeys. The TOC Biometrics SIGNER validates ‚Äì triangulates ‚Äì that the verification has been correctly carried out and that the established business rules have been met. If the biometric transaction was valid, the signer stamps the document digitally with a certificate and the data of the person ‚Äì as well as the photo of the face used ‚Äì are captured on the document. The digital certificate that is  stamped  on the document contains the property of TIMESTAMP, which allows administrators to know with certainty the exact moment ‚Äì both time and date ‚Äì of the signature. This property is immutable. In addition, TOC Biometrics generates a log for each signature made, identifying the integrator, the signer and also the TIMESTAMP associated with the digital certificate, which allows a traceability of the signature. We make this data available to the integrator. OUR TECHNOLOGY: THE WORLD S MOST ADVANCED ID VERIFICATION SOLUTIONS FROM TOC BIOMETRICS. CLOUD-BASED BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION: Leading the fight against Identity Theft Whatever industry sector or government department you re in, Identity Theft is a big problem ‚Äì and it s getting bigger every day. It is already the world s most common type of fraud but with the ongoing digital revolution and the steady rise in online transactions, the daily occurrence of Identity Theft is increasing exponentially. The simple answer for banking, insurance, retail, healthcare and government organisations is to authenticate their current and future clients remotely ‚Äì both online and mobile. Unfortunately, traditional authentication solutions will only link a given device with the corresponding customer account ‚Äì rather than authenticating the actual user themselves. Fortunately, at TOC Biometrics we have solved this problem by developing the world s most advanced ID Verification solution. Device authentication is not Identity Verification Even modern devices that use biometric data ‚Äì like fingerprint scanning and facial recognition ‚Äì still only link users to the device where the data is stored. The true power of biometric authentication will only be unleashed when organisations move the process away from the device and onto the cloud. Our unique cloud-based biometric ID Verification service creates a unique digital template for genuine customers which is then stored securely in the form of a mathematical construct, so that any organisations or institutions can accurately verify that it is the correct person ‚Äì not just the correct device ‚Äì performing a transaction. The ID Verification service from TOC Biometrics comprises a number of advanced technology components and there are many more exciting developments in the pipeline. BIOMETRIC FACIAL RECOGNITION: The advanced Biometric Facial Recognition solution from TOC Biometrics is based on cutting-edge neural network and deep learning technology. With an accuracy rate already greater than 99%, the specialised Biometric Facial Recognition engine is trained to compare photos taken by users with photos on their official ID documents and identify a positive match. The system is continuously learning so performance and accuracy will improve further over time. Reduce operational risk Ensure regulatory compliance Lower processing costs Improve customer service. ID DOCUMENT CHECKING Discover what the new ID Verification Service from TOC Biometrics can do for your business, explore our functionality with our live demo apps and register for an account to road-test our API. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Facial Recognition technology generally involves determining the identity of an individual person by capturing a number of intrinsic facial characteristics and comparing them with the images of a group of people already classified. The traditional matching process relies on computer algorithms which are notoriously inaccurate ‚Äì they are often deliberately configured to generate false positive results that a human then needs to check, verify and eliminate. To improve the effectiveness of this artificial vision and matching task, TOC Biometrics has developed an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine that focuses on comparing just two sets of facial data ‚Äì usually a self-taken photograph and the image on an official identity card. We have created a convolutional neural network (CNN) in which neurons correspond to receptive fields ‚Äì this is very similar to the way neurons in the primary visual cortex of a biological human brain work. Reduce operational risk Ensure regulatory compliance Lower processing costs Improve customer service. LIVENESS DETECTION: For Facial Recognition technology to work effectively as an ID Verification system, it has to be able to differentiate between a real, live human being and a two-dimensional photo or video of that person. The Liveness Detection feature from TOC Biometrics analyses still and moving images and uses complex algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to establish that a person is, indeed, alive. Reduce operational risk Ensure regulatory compliance Lower processing costs Improve customer service. YOUR INDUSTRY: Whether you are a bank, insurer, retailer, healthcare provider or government agency, the advanced ID Verification Service from TOC Biometrics can help you transform your digital customer authentication processes. OUR SOLUTIONS: INTRODUCING THE WORLD S MOST ADVANCED ID VERIFICATION SERVICE FROM TOC BIOMETRICS. The ID Verification System from TOC Biometrics ‚Äì based on Deep Learning ‚Äì allows you to verify your user s identity remotely in the cloud without the need for any special hardware or software.

We do this by creating, implementing and supporting Face Recognition software solutions for national and global clients to better serve and safeguard their customers. ""We add to a stress free life taking away the thought that; have I got my house keys, my car keys, my office pass, my season ticket, my credit card, my loyalty card, my gym access card, my hotel bedroom key or my wallet. You also don t have to worry whether you have internet access or is my battery charged!""  Everything is triggered by your FACE! FaceStream Lite: We provide anonymous but accurate footfall, demographic (age & gender) and mood information which helps organisations improve their knowledge and understanding of their visiting customers  behaviour. The resulting insights into customer segmentation and predictive analytics (InSite2) can then be used to manage resources more effectively and so maximise revenue and profitability. Also relevant content can be triggered and presented on Digital Signage. No personal data is stored. FaceStream Plus: FaceStream Plus provides footfall and demographic data and adds people recognition from a stored digital image that the system is able to recognise, allow access and notify staff upon them entering the building - VIPs, valued and repeat customers. They can then benefit from the customer s bespoke and premium level of service. Those that arrive and need assistance can be helped immediately by an appropriate customer service agent or the notification of registered troublemakers making it a safer environment. In this case individuals need to have agreed to their data being held as part of the GDPR rules. Facentry - Access Control: Using an individual s FACE as a means of authentication is one of the most secure, unobtrusive and easy ways to ensure a person s validity and allow them access to information, a room or a building. Your FACE is being used to unlock you phone so why not your car, you house, your office your Hotel bedroom and even gaining access to the gym 24/7. Facentry has been developed to be secure (anti face spoofing is built-in) and if a person wishes to not use their FACE a QR code can be used instead. The QR code option can also provide 2 factor authentication - FACE and QR code have to be entered before access allowed. AgeCheck: Age Verification is the core component to TouchByte s software product AgeCheck. A customer purchases an age restricted product and the system using the FACE algorithm estimates their age. For safety the system has a set limit of age 30 so if anyone who the system thinks is over 30 the transaction will continue with no intervention. If the system thinks the person is under 30 the transaction is held and the procedure reverts to the normal personal validation. We monitor the whole transaction from start to finish so if we see anyone young during the transaction it reverts back to normal. Individuals can choose to enrol on the system so there is no need to carry ID. The software can be used for Supermarket self-service checkouts, lottery terminals, slot machines, online gambling and other age related applications. Investment - TouchByte is currently seeking funding to accelorate it s growth potential. Solutions for most sectors! Retail, Transport, Leisure, Hotels, Education, Health, Marine, Home Care.

Our patented technology creates tokenized identities from any biometric modality (or other identity data), from any source. The most comprehensive AI-powered facial biometric identity authentication solution. We provide Identity and Trust as a Service to answer two fundamental questions: ""Who are you?"" and ""Do I trust you?"" Our patented technology creates tokenized identities (using a proprietary EgHash‚Ñ¢ architecture) from any modality or source allowing comparison of like-modality templates from different sources, and breaking vendor lock-in. Our immutable EgHash‚Ñ¢ is created using a one-way transformation, isnot-PII and is ""anonymized data"" under legislation such as GDPR. Using our hashing to create digital identities protects against databreaches and allows controlled data sharing as only our AI can create a probabilistic zero knowledge proof as to whether two EgHash‚Ñ¢ originated from the same person. Our EgHash‚Ñ¢ can also act as a pivot to unlimited externally stored data and using pivot tables, the linked data and access permissions can be changed to reflect changes in data needs and render data access ""self-sovereign"". Combined with proof of life and other presentation attack detection AI s, our hashing process identifies duplicate and synthetic identities that pass siloed KYC/AML/onboarding processes.  The EgHash‚Ñ¢ can be stored on-premises and/or in the cloud and/or in a blockchain or other distributed ledger, or even on the originating device. To counter fraud, the EgHash‚Ñ¢ can be stored or copied to a shared Identity Lake‚Ñ¢ and/or used to service zero-knowledge-proofs.  Whether you need to onboard new users, provide access to existing accounts, authenticate for higher risk transactions, identify persons-of-interest, or create identities for undocumentedor thin-file subjects, our hashing technology will work with your existing and future authentication modalities to provide an unparalleled level of efficiency and security for your identity programs. TrustStamp.ai for Banking and Fintech: We empower financial institutions to onboard customers faster, keep accounts secure, and prevent fraudsters from accessing services. Financial Institutions rely on secure, accurate, and efficient identity authentication solutions to protect themselves and their customers. Trust Stamp works with organizations on the cutting edge of financial security to do just that. TrustStamp.ai for Real Estate: We empower agents to trust and identify clients before meeting them in potentially risky situations. Using Trust Stamp for your business: We use sophisticated algorithms and artificial intelligence to prove your customer s identity then our service reads the data from your customer s documents to create the customer report. Agents must confirm the data provided by their customers and that they have met them. Our service assists Estate Agents in meeting the requirements of the Regulations but is not a substitute for the Risk Based Assessment demanded by law. TrustStamp.ai for Biometrically-Secured Email: The first end-to-end encrypted email protected with the most secure biometric marker: your face. TrustStamp.ai for KYC/AML Compliance We make complying with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements easy. Your Solution to Email Fraud  When we share confidential information with a confidante we ideally do so ""face to face"" but how can that work using the speed and convenience of an e-mail? With Trusted Mail the recipient is confident that the communication was generated by a specific sender and has not been tampered with en-route. To protect e-mail in transit, Trusted Mail layers proprietary encryption techniques utilizing hashed facial biometrics. TrustStamp.ai for KYC/AML Compliance: We make complying with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements easy. Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering. To address the exponential growth in KYC/AML requirements, we empower businesses with a completely automated transaction including our facial biometric tools and proprietary document OCR. Our multi-layer, automated, risk-based process speeds the process for both institutions and customers and provides audit trails, compliance reports and fuzzy logic to identify risky transactions and potential non-compliance. Humanitarian: Identifying victims of human trafficking with international Attorneys General. In collaboration with CWAG (Conference of Western Attorneys General) and the Alliance Partnership, Trust Stamp has built a consortium Identity Lake shared between the Attorneys General of New Mexico and Guanajuato, Mexico. Using Trust Stamp s Facial Matching and Hashing Technology, the two Attorneys General offices can share hashes related to human trafficking persons of interest. The Identity Lake is a proven method of cross jurisdictional, compliant data sharing. Technology that creates unique, irreversible hashed-tokenized identities and facilitates secure, interoperable identity proofing ‚Äì anywhere in the world, online and offline.  WHAT: Irreversible, hashed-tokenized identities. WHY: The effectiveness of all identity data is maximized when it is rendered safe to use, store, and share. HOW: Deep neural networks convert any identifying data into a unique, non-PII EgHash. Security. Interoperability. WHAT: Secure, interoperable identity proofing. WHY: Zero-knowledge authentication provides security beyond that of siloed, legacy authentication systems that are prone to sensitive data leakage and fraud. HOW: Probabilistic AI predicts whether multiple EgHashes came from the same face, without the need to store or share sensitive information. Our mission is to create transformational technology that accelerates secure societal and financial inclusion. Current Issues. Synthetic Identity Fraud: Fraudsters have access to fraudulent identification documents which allow them to pass siloed biometric systems. Annually, over $40 Billion lost to synthetic and stolen identity fraud and over $20 Billion lost to legitimate transactions failing legacy authentication. Security: Legacy identity authentication takes place in a ""silo"" with matched data required for authentication. Data points used are virtually always PII and data leakage at one institution can invalidate authentication at multiple institutions. Financial Inclusion: Over 2 Billion people globally are undocumented & financially excluded, and 4 Billion people are financially under-served. This represents a potential $3.7 Trillion annual growth in global GDPR. Our Vision: A world where secure, trusted identity is a universal human right, empowering opportunity and access -- and technical interoperability facilitates an open ecosystem, enabling barrier-free global value exchange. Secure & Trusted Identity for all People: Every human being, regardless of location or connectivity, has an established existence and a means of proving their identity without the need to share personal records. Opportunity & Access: Access to services is no longer limited by a person s ability to prove identity, making the opportunity for economic mobility and elevated quality of life universal.

Remotely Authenticate Quickly, Securely and Cost-efficiently Without compromising on regulation compliance. EMPLOYEE AUTHENTICATION Remote Authentication. Be more secure and cost-efficient. Reduce IT help desk calls. Biometric Employee Authentication. Like many organizations, you probably find yourself performing a constant balancing act: on one hand, you need your employees to create complex, unique and uncrackable passwords, and you need them updating regularly‚Ä¶ on the other, they need something they can actually remember! It s an impossible decision ‚Äì do you sacrifice security for usability, or usability for security? Whichever way you go, there are enormous costs involved; whether it s reputational damage from passwords lost through a security breach, or just the time and resources it takes to reset forgotten passwords, removing passwords from the employee authentication process is a win-win for everyone involved. A User Experience Like No Other A simple multi-factor biometric authentication process makes accessing apps easier for your employees and more difficult for malicious actors. Offering facial, fingerprint and passive behavioral options, alongside native or third-party biometrics, Veridium lets your employees authenticate without tying them up in endless layers of security ‚Äì and what s more, it keeps track of everything that s happening, ensuring non-repudiation, traceability and regulatory compliance. Enable Employees to Work From Home - Securely Using biometric mobile first MFA your employees can remotely authenticate, without a compromise on security and all the while ensuring non-repudiation. Regulatory requirements are also met, for example behavioural biometrics ensure geo-location access is managed, and our distributed storage ensures GDPR compliance. Cut Costs and Increase Productivity. Employee Authentication with Veridium: COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM? IAM PARTNERSHIPS LEGALLY BINDING AUDIT TRAILS REGULATORY COMPLIANCE CLOUD AGNOSTIC. Remove Password Vulnerabilities. Improve Cybersecurity. CUSTOMER AUTHENTICATION Create a customer-winning user experience. Authenticate your customers. Simple and Secure We ve all been there. You want to move some money around, but can t remember your banking app s password. Or you re trying to buy something online, and have to toggle between apps to enter a one-time SMS code. It s infuriating, and you wouldn t be alone if you ve ended up abandoning your efforts. The VeridiumID biometric authentication platform lets you offer customers a simpler authentication experience. Using technologies they re already comfortable with, and the native hardware on their own devices, you can provide an authentication process that is not only easier than that of your competitors, but significantly more secure, all whilst complying with security regulations. Reduce Fraud. Increase Customer Satisfaction. TRANSACTION AUTHENTICATION Have non-repudiation. Always be compliant. Why Go Passwordless? Increased security, lower operational costs and a frictionless user experience, for even remote working, are some of the reasons why authentication is going passwordless. There s a reason passwords, pins, codes and tokens all persist, despite their user experience drawbacks ‚Äì security always has to be a top priority. While consumers and employees expect technology to deliver ever-simpler means of going about their business, they also recognize the dangers of online life. As sensitive data becomes ever more ubiquitous, and threats more sophisticated, governmental legislation and customer expectations require a constant balancing act between user experience and transaction protection. Mobile Multi-Factor Authentication Whether it s a customer confirming an online purchase, a lawyer needing an important legal document signed with non-repudiation baked in or a financial-trader making multi-million dollar transactions, non-repudiation authentication is a complicated business. The demands for multiple layers of authentication involve inconvenient and time-consuming hoops through which users must jump, and offer endless opportunities for both malicious attacks and human nature to subvert the process. Passwordless Authentication VeridiumID offers multi-factor biometric authentication through a user s own smartphone. No lost, stolen or loaned passwords. Taking advantage of a phone s native sensors you can now deploy multiple points of authentication through a single, familiar process. And because some transactions require more scrutiny than others, our step-up options are also completely passwordless, meaning you can be certain that someone is exactly who they say they are. Facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, behavioral analytics. Better Experience = Better Security. Cost Control. Managing user authentication can have a significant impact on a company s bottom line. Resetting passwords and replacing lost tokens cost organizations money.

It began with a blue string Growing up on a farm, hay bales were a staple of Kaarel Kotkas s childhood. At the age of 14, he noticed that the strings that bound them did not biodegrade, and often ended up littered across the fields of the otherwise pristine landscape of rural Estonia. Kaarel set out to find an environmentally-friendly alternative, and after browsing the web he came across the perfect string (it also came in his favorite color). As he registered an account on arguably the biggest global online marketplace, he was asked to verify that he was over 18. After a little photo editing, he breezed through their security and was able to buy the string. While his mission was a success, Kaarel couldn t stop thinking about how easy it was to pretend to be someone else online. If successful companies are this vulnerable to fraud, then smaller businesses don t stand a chance. This early experience planted the seed that would one day grow into Veriff. Kaarel founded Veriff in 2015 at the age of 20. Shortly after, it popped up on the global radar and in 2018 it joined the Y Combinator spring batch. Fast forward to now, Veriff has over 300 employees and serves over 190 countries as the gold standard for online identity verification.",https://www.veriff.com/,670,2.01E+13,2.03E+13

State-of-the-art face recognition: detection, tracking, identification as well as age and gender estimation - actively developed by Videmo for over 10 years. Face recognition directly from the manufacturer At Videmo, you get the recognition technology and the corresponding application from a single source. This way you can be sure to always get the best possible performance. Proven in practice It is important for us that our algorithms achieve good results not only in synthetic benchmarks but also in practical applications. Focus on video processing Our methods are inherently optimized for video processing, both live and retrospective. Up to date Having close contacts with research institutions, we are able to quickly incorporate the latest algorithms into our software. Deep Learning Deep Neural Networks (DNN) represent the state of the art in image analysis and are the technological foundation of our recognition methods. We train and evaluate neural networks with large amounts of data in order to achieve the optimal combination of recognition performance and speed. With hardware support (e.g. graphics cards), the high performance of the networks can also be used in real-time applications. Everything at a glance. Face detection We reliably find the position and location of faces in photos or videos. This usually works despite of unfavorable lighting, rotations, partial occlusion or poor video quality. In video, faces are tracked from frame to frame to form continuous tracks. These tracks can be used for more precise identification than single frames alone. Face recognition For facial recognition, so-called templates are extracted, which represent the individual characteristics of each face in a compact way. These templates can then be compared with reference templates of query identities. Creating identities from more than one reference template (""enrollment"") leads to better recognition rates than with single template comparison. Age and gender In addition to classic identification, the age and gender of individuals can also be estimated by analyzing the face. Thus, you can create statistics on the age and gender distribution of customer groups or start searches for these features (""soft biometrics""). Videmo 360 Face recognition redefined. Videmo 360 is the latest generation of face recognition software, combining retrospective analysis and live observation capabilities in a distributed, client-server-ready solution. Integrate cameras from remote observation points, and let teams of operators analyze large amounts of video footage.

Range of possible applications of our technologies includes security surveillance systems, audience analysis for Digital signage, intelligent search in video archives, augmented reality systems, etc. In 2010 our project ""Video-based demographic and behavioral audience analysis system"" was supported under the START program of State Fund for Support of Small Enterprises in the Scientific-Technical Fields. In 2011 the project was extended for the second year. In 2013 our company received a status of Skolkovo resident with a project ""Automatic annotation of video surveillance data for business intelligence and security systems"" At this point our key technologies are: gender and age classification face recognition face features detection. Face Classification From face image it is possible to determine a number of human attributes, such as gender, age, ethnicity, facial hair type and color, presence of spectacles, etc. It is also possible to determine face expressions, for example a smile. The problem of visual appearance features estimation from face images is generally known as  face classification . Face classification is useful in a number of different application, e.g: Demographic profiling of customers (e.g. for shop, cafe or retail bank office) Measurement of efficiency and audience analysis of Digital Signage systems Search of people in surveillance video archive Intelligent human-computer interface A pipeline of face classification algorithms is very similar to that of face recognition algorithms Extraction of person s faces from an image (Face Detection) Localization of facial keypoints (Face Features Detection). Often this stage is limited to specification of human s eyes only. Face image normalization, including image resize to the predefined resolution, head inclination elimination, face color correction (Face Normalization) Face descriptor computation. Contrary to the general knowledge, relative distances between facial keypoints are rarely used for face analysis and person identification. Usually a specific set of texture-based features are computed. (Feature extraction and descriptor computation) Person attributes estimation from descriptor. Pattern recognition algorithms, based on machine learning, are usually used for it. (Classification) The main performance characteristics of face classification algorithms are classification speed and precision. Similarly to face recognition algorithms precision of face classification substantially depends on the input data quality: image resolution and sharpness, viewing angle, lighting conditions, person mimic. Depending on the image the precision of the same classification algorithm can decrease from 95% to 50-70%. We have developed our own face classification algorithm. On our internal test dataset of 100K+ real-life photos gender classification accuracy is 90.1%, and mean age estimation error is 7.8 years. To evaluate its performance on your application we offer to test our software on your image dataset. If you have a large dataset for your specific scenario, our face classification algorithm can be tuned (trained) on your data, which will guarantee its maximal precision on this scenario. Face recognition Face recognition is one of the most demanded computer vision technologies for security systems and web-search. A list of potential applications includes: Identification of the person from photo (e.g. face matching with a photo database of known criminals) Access control for high-security places Identity confirmation (verification) by biometric passport Person search in surveillance video archive Automatic annotation of photos and videos in social networks Two application scenarios for face recognition should be distinguished: ""Face identification"". A face image of unknown person (named as ""test image"") and a gallery of known person s photos are supplied to the identification algorithm. The goal is to determine whether a person on the test image is present in the gallery, and if present to determine which one. ""Face verification"" or ""person identity confirmation"". Only two images are used as input data. Algorithm should determine whether both images capture the same person or two different persons. In general each scenario can be reduced to the other one. But each scenario sets different requirements on face recognition algorithm, which results in different training and tuning procedures. Most face recognition algorithms share the same operation procedure: Extraction of person s faces from an image (Face Detection) Localization of facial keypoints (Face Features Detection). Often this stage is limited to specification of human s eyes only. Face image normalization, including image resize to the predefined resolution, head inclination elimination, face color correction (Face Normalization) Face descriptor computation. Contrary to the general knowledge, relative distances between facial keypoints are rarely used for face analysis and person identification. Usually a specific set of texture-based features are computed. (Feature extraction and descriptor computation) Comparisons of descriptors of different faces (Verification, Template Matching) Usually several steps after face detection and before verification are collectively named ""Enrollment"", meaning that a new face image is processed and stored in the database. As face recognition algorithm is a pipeline, constructed from several consecutively applied algorithms, performance depends on accuracy of each stage. Technical details of each step are usually a commercial secret and described in a very general way. The main performance characteristics of face identification algorithms are descriptor computation speed (Enrollment), descriptors comparison time, precision of person identification Performance of face identification depends on many factors: image resolution (more correct face size on an image), image sharpness, viewing angle (frontal or at an angle), lighting, mimic, and size of the gallery. That is why an ""abstract"" recognition precision, mentioned in different news releases, without binding to a concrete face image dataset, used for measurements, does mean absolutely nothing. Under some ideal conditions a recognition precision can be even higher than human performance and reach the precision, demonstrated by eye iris recognition. But in practice the image recognition precision is significantly lower, which limits the range of possible applications. We have developed our own face recognition algorithm. To evaluate its performance on your application we offer to test our software on your image dataset. Face features detection Precise localization of facial keyponts, such as eye s centers, lips corners, nose tip, etc., is a necessary step for most face image analysis algorithms e.g. face recognition or classification. Also precise keypoint localization is necessary for image editing or manipulation. For example, augmented reality applications require keypoint localization to integrate virtual objects (hat or spectacles) in video stream. In many cases for face normalization it is enough to supply only a few selected keypoints, e.g. corners or centers of eyes. However, to improve robustness and precision a more extended set of keypoints is required, which permits to take into account their reciprocal position. Our face features detection algorithm permits localization of main anthropometric points in on-line video stream. FaceSDK is a software development kit that provides the face analysis engine to system integrators and other customers. Features include: face detection face tracking gender and age classification face recognition face features detection. Tevian Face Detection is an embedded application for Axis ip cameras. It allows storing face images in a local or remote archive. Also it can be used in conjunction with face recognition, running on a remote server. Quelytics is a cloud application to estimate queue size using video surveillance cameras. Licensing of our computer vision algorithms We have a range of licensing options for our technologies, including: unlimited non-exclusive license limited license, price based on number of computers limited license, price based on number of algorithm s runs Custom development and algorithm adaptation Many end-user applications set a specific set of requirements, which cannot be fulfilled by out-of-the box algorithms and SDKs. We can adapt our technologies to any custom application. In simple cases such adaptation requires only training and fine tuning of our algorithms on new custom dataset. In complex cases we can develop new algorithms starting from scratch. Consulting From our experience it is quite difficult for many potential customers to see both the capabilities and limitations of modern computer vision technologies. Judging from Hollywood movies and TV-shows, forensic experts can reliably identify a person of interest by magnifying a one pixel reflection in a mirror (which is, regretfully, not theoretically possible). But a lot of existing applications are not as widely popularized in modern arts. We can help with: establishing what problems can or cannot be solved with the help of modern computer vision algorithms choosing from available ready solutions search for a scientific papers on your subject Development of complete software solutions We offer a development of integrated system for solution of a specific computer vision problem.",,,,

BIOMETRIC VERIFICATION: STRENGTHENS YOUR ONBOARDING PROCESS greenID‚Ñ¢ Mobile incorporates biometric verification to reduce fraud Using greenID‚Ñ¢ Mobile you can capture customer details visually or audibly, for use as one-time verification or to be stored for future authentication purposes. Facial Biometrics Tests Ranked  1 Facial biometrics compare an image of an individual (such as a driver s licence photo) with a real-time image of that person (a selfie) to verify authenticity. The facial recognition system then uses algorithms and pattern matching to correctly identify face prints when images differ due to posing angle, illumination, facial hair, glasses and ageing. Most importantly, it reduces fraud and acts as a simple deterrent during the identity verification process, further reducing costs involved with manual checks. Voice Biometrics for Extra Security Voice biometrics compares a person s voiceprint to determine their identity. Once recorded, a customer voice can be checked against a range of factors including pitch, spectral magnitudes and frequencies. This combination of sound, pattern and rhythm is different to a natural conversation and provides a trusted verification tool that s difficult to fool. Capturing voiceprints is very simple, accurate and discreet facilitating a positive customer experience. Liveness Detection To protect yourself and your company against fraud, greenID‚Ñ¢ incorporates detection measures to ensure that a real person, not a computer BOT, is involved in transactions. For example, individuals must blink when taking a selfie to prove they are live and not merely a static photo. To combat pre-recorded voices, the system prompts individuals to repeat randomly generated phrases or a sequence of numbers to prove that they are human and not a recording.

1065,Voatz,United States,2015,Private,0,0,1,1,0,1,https://www.voatz.com,https://voatz.com/,no strong candidates; using root landing,"Voting Redefined. Voatz is on a mission to make voting safer and more accessible. All citizens have a right to vote regardless of their circumstance. Available only by invitation from your election organizer in selected jurisdictions only. Are you an election administrator interested in trying out Voatz at your next federal, state or local election? Who is Voatz? Voatz is a mobile elections platform that makes it possible to vote from a mobile device by leveraging the security built into the latest versions of smartphone technology, and the immutability of the blockchain. Since June 2016, more than 80,000 votes have been cast on the Voatz platform across more than 50 elections. Voatz has experience working with both major political parties, churches, unions, universities, towns, cities, counties and state governments, all in the effort to make it safe, convenient and easy to vote. Why is Voatz in the elections industry? Voatz was started in 2015 by two co-founders after winning a hackathon at SXSW with an idea that would become the early seedlings of the Voatz platform. With careers in technology,digital security and mobile payments, they started an experiment to combine the latest advancements in smartphone technology with biometrics and blockchain technology in order to make voting more accessible and potentially evade voter coercion in certain circumstances. Voatz has since grown into a group of passionate people, all working to make voting as safe, accessible, easy and secure as possible. Yes. To date, Voatz has conducted more than 30 successful live elections that range from state party conventions, student government elections and town meeting voting. A number of these elections were scoped as pilots that have led to longer-term relationships with clients. In the largest election, more than 15,000 votes were cast. The purpose of all the Voatz pilots is to first and foremost deliver on stakeholder expectations, while also continuing to learn and improve the Voatz platform. On the Voatz app, authentication is a three-step process that uses the smartphone s camera and its biometric feature (i.e. fingerprint recognition or facial recognition): (1) the voter scans their state driver s license or passport, (2) takes a live facial snapshot (a video ""selfie""), and (3) touches the fingerprint reader on the smartphone, which ties the voter s device to the voter. Once the voter is authenticated, the app matches the voter s ""selfie"" to the facial picture on their passport or driver s license and confirms the voter s eligibility to vote against the state s voter registration database. Our Approach To Security. Security has been our utmost priority since day one, and it begins with how we build our technology. Across our corporate and elections infrastructure we follow industry best practices, including end-to-end encryption and layered security to provide defense in depth. In addition, we invest in frequent, ongoing audits by independent third parties external to Voatz. These audits involve a comprehensive examination of our voting platform, including the mobile application source code, backend infrastructure, and blockchain, as well as an assessment of the networks, computing devices, and processes used to transmit, process, and store voting data. We have voluntarily engaged with multiple agencies in DHS, including their Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with one of the leading federal testing labs in the nation to review the technologies deployed in our pilots. These audits are ongoing, and due to the ever-evolving nature of threats, repeated examinations of this kind are critical in our pursuit of security as a continuous exercise. We remain committed to providing as much transparency as possible about our system, which is why we encourage the research community to participate in our public bug bounty program hosted on HackerOne. This program grants qualified security researchers access to the latest versions of the Voatz mobile voting platform to report vulnerabilities and provide us valuable feedback. We also offer the opportunity to probe deeper for more qualified researchers. We encourage the research community to actively participate in our bug bounty program as it ensures that any issues detected are specific to Voatz in the context of a real-world environment, and that issues reported are able to be demonstrated with evidence that can be used to improve the security of our platform. Testing or probing non-Voatz owned and operated infrastructure components that have been created and configured outside of Voatz is not a genuine method to test the Voatz environment. We continue to pursue comprehensive security measures as we evolve as a company, and we take any reports of the existence of vulnerabilities in our mobile voting platform with the highest degree of scrutiny and concern. All of this is in pursuit of our mission ‚Äî that every citizen has the right to vote safely and securely regardless of their circumstances.",,,,

Wobot s Video Analytics platform helps businesses to monitor compliance and SOP adherence.  Visual based process compliance, All the time! Our Work: Computer Vision solutions to help monitor your business operations. At Wobot, we all come to work everyday because we want to solve the biggest problem in Surveillance - analysis of tons of data in the form of videos. All big enterprises use CCTV surveillance to track their business operations. This requires manual monitoring which is inaccurate and time consuming. Its because of this shortcoming that CCTVs are often reduced to a mere tool for post-mortem analysis.  Wobot Intelligence helps businesses make sense of this data by implementing a layer of Artificial Intelligence which makes the system capable of doing surveillance on behalf of the human eye. Our machine learning algorithms can detect any deviations in standard operating procedures (SOPs) and automatically list them and make them track able for all relevant stakeholders in the organisation. Industries: Our video and image recognition models can be custom developed as per your needs; we help bring intelligence to your surveillance and reduce the need for manual monitoring.

Solving the problem of analysis of tons of data in form of videos. Technology: Harnessing the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence. Detect any change in SOPs using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Activity Recognition: Video analysis tasks have been shifting from deducing the present situation to forecasting the future situation. Vision-based Action Recognition is used to deduce human actions in present state, based upon complete action executions, and action prediction to predict human actions in future state based upon incomplete action executions. These two tasks have become particularly widespread recently because of their emerging real-world applications, such as mopping detection, wiping detection, talking on phone, aggressive behaviour detection, etc. Facial Recognition: Facial recognition is a category of biometric software that maps an individual s facial features mathematically and stores the data as a faceprint. The software uses deep learning algorithms to compare a live capture or digital image to the stored faceprint in order to verify an individual s identity. With advancements in technology, it is now a viable option for authentication as well as identification. Face recognition is one of the few biometric methods that possess the merits of both high accuracy and low intrusiveness. Its use cases include face ID, photograph tagging, smart advertisements by identifying face ID, authentication and security. Object Detection: The goal of object detection is to notice or discover the presence of real-world objects within an image or video frame and to be able to tell an object apart from the static background. Object detection algorithms typically use extracted features and learning algorithms to recognize instances of an object category. It is commonly used in applications such as image retrieval, security, surveillance, and automated vehicle parking systems. Some use cases of object detection include face recognition, object tracking and anomaly detection. Posture Detection: Posture is a way in which a human holds his body so that there is less strain on muscles during movement. Posture detection is done by determining three dimensional orientations by tracking the movement and orientation of a body with respect to a custom axes. Its use cases include real-time posture detection (talking on the phone, aggressive behavior, etc.), kinect and 3D camera based body posture detection. Pattern Detection: Pattern recognition is a programmed or learned ability to recognise patterns within data sets. It is a fast developing field, which underpins developments in fields such as computer vision, image processing, text and document analysis and neural networks. Machines are trained to recognize the required images based on a particular pattern like recognizing a person s face based on a particular pattern. Video streams provide us access to rich temporal patterns which are captured using AI. These temporal patterns present us with various spatial patterns which are used in applications like activity recognition, event detection/classification, anomaly detection, activity based person identification etc. Powering innovation across multiple industrial sectors. Custom develop your AI solution to bring intelligence to surveillance. At Wobot Intelligence, the world s most talented engineers, designers, and thought leaders are shaping the future of Video Surveillance.",,,,

The idea for Zippin was born when co-founder and CEO, Krishna Motukuri, was sent out to buy organic milk for his young toddler. Finding an excruciatingly long line at his favorite store, he abandoned Plan A, and ended up buying cheap milk at the local corner store. Plan B wasn t received too well at home, and he realized that there had to be a better way. Fast forward to today. Here at Zippin we have developed the next generation of checkout-free technology enabling retailers to quickly deploy frictionless shopping in their stores. Our patent-pending approach uses AI, machine learning and sensor fusion technology to create the best consumer experience. Our vision is to banish checkout lines and self-scanners for good, so shoppers can zip in and out with their purchases. Zippin was founded by industry veterans from Amazon and SRI with deep backgrounds in retail technology, AI, and computer vision. We have received venture funding from some of Silicon Valley s best known firms. We Know Retail and AI.",https://www.getzippin.com/,258,2.02E+13,2.03E+13

Tap into the growing motherlode of machine learning. Discover value you didn t know you had. INTUITIVE AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING FOR YOUR BUSINESS. Zorroa automatically organizes all your digital visual assets - documents, images, and video - so valuable insights are always just a quick search away. Put the latest advances in machine learning to work to analyze and extract the valuable data hidden within these assets, regardless of where they are stored - from server farms to the cloud. INTUITIVE: You don t need a PhD to use complex machine learning tools. The Zorroa Visual Intelligence platform is built to be user-friendly, so anyone can get meaningful insights from their visual assets. FLEXIBLE: Use the best algorithms available to analyze your domain-specific problems - you can even easily deploy multiple algorithms across your distributed asset collections. AUTOMATIC: Visual data - documents, images, and video - is your fastest growing asset. Keep it organized with automatic analysis, tagging, and sorting, so you can quickly browse and search all your assets when you need to find them. FUTURE-PROOF: Stay current with improvements in machine learning technology that continually provide new ways to analyze and monetize your assets, so you can make the most of these machine learning algorithms now and in the future. PLACES YOU CAN FIND ZORROA. OIL AND GAS: Mine and Explore Your Own Data Repository. Analyze all your proprietary unstructured data to make better business decisions. Zorroa s established domain expertise in the analysis of visual assets is now enabling oil and gas companies to make better, faster decisions, and dramatically reduce the time and cost of asset discovery. Through the use of Zorroa Visual Intelligence (ZVI), companies can maximize the value of their unstructured data automatically and access it through a single-view browser interface. It is ideal for geologists, geophysicists, and analysts to consider every piece of data available when making critical decisions. In many cases, companies own a wealth of visual assets in dark, legacy data files accumulated over decades which are impossible to manually analyze. At the same time, analysts are managing a huge influx of unstructured visual data from drone footage, downhole sensors, and other internet-enabled field technology. Due to this ever increasing repository of visual assets, analysts are unable to leverage huge portions of their data when making high-risk and high-stakes decisions. For example, an analyst looking to acquire a piece of land may have 90 days to give an estimate of value. The land is in a region that is restricted to exploration, but her company has documents from prospecting the area years ago‚Äîin paper files that were recently digitized with no attached metadata. In this situation, her buying offer is determined by whatever she finds manually searching through digital documents and a fair amount of guesswork. With ZVI, an analyst with no special training can maximize the value of her company s visual assets with machine learning, whether they are scanned paper files or unstructured images. Data quality can be enhanced by matching known metadata and external databases to the assets, so they can be easily searched based on a range of metrics including date prospected, well type, basin, GPS location, and more. ZVI s flexibility allows the analyst to search and inspect millions of visual assets across fragmented data silos in minutes, all accessible in an intuitive interface. To inform her purchasing decision, she can pull relevant information from dark data in minutes based on optical character recognition correlated with GPS data. Searching a particular region will give her a comprehensive view of the well logs, microphotography, core photography, progress charts, seismic profiles, and anything else that she might need to assess value of the specific area, regardless of where that data is stored. ZVI automatically organizes incoming visual assets including seismic surveys, land lease agreements, planning documents, and maintenance records so they can be searched quickly at any time. As a partner to oil and gas companies, Zorroa enables customers to future proof their investment in artificial intelligence with the most up-to-date technology, on-location or in the cloud. See what Zorroa Visual Intelligence can do for your company. MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT: From Big Screen to Big Data. Helping organizations understand and monetize massive collections of visual assets. With a combined 280 years of experience in the media and entertainment industry, Zorroa s team provides users an added layer of monetizable business intelligence to their digital content. Zorroa Visual Intelligence (ZVI) enables users to organize, search, and find the assets they need in an intuitive interface with no technical training. Companies with millions of images and video assets hold enormous value in their unstructured data, much of which remains untapped because extracting this value is reliant on employees  time and memory. With ZVI, anyone interested in finding specific content can execute advanced unstructured discovery on all their assets, providing the user with a unified view of results in a matter of seconds. For example, if an editor is looking for a specific effect for a movie, they can decide to invest two to three weeks to recreate it‚Äîor search for one they already have. With ZVI, the editor can use visual cues to search and instantly find every available option for that type of effect. Zorroa s flexibility allows users to leverage multiple machine learning tools, including facial recognition, natural language processing, and optical character recognition to enrich their search. ZVI can apply these tools wherever the assets are already stored‚Äîon premise, in the cloud, or in a production tracking software like Shotgun. Zorroa s plug-and-play architecture gives users access to the best-in-class algorithms and a future-proof investment in machine learning. As more content is analyzed and automatically organized, ZVI learns more about an organization and its assets. Metadata automatically generated during this process makes the assets more usable and monetizable to all relevant departments in an organization. THERE S VALUE IN YOUR DATA. LET US PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET. Zorroa has licensing options to suit your business ‚Äî whether you require a secure cloud-hosted or on-premise solution. HOW WILL ZORROA IMPROVE YOUR BUSINESS? Intuitive applications of machine learning can provide a competitive edge to any business with a large number of visual assets. You need the right tools to understand your data - Zorroa can help. Machine learning made simple for the enterprise. ZORROA S UNIQUE POSITIONING. Why is Zorroa different? Most digital asset analysis companies don t provide any way for you to actually utilize their results. They don t provide mechanisms that let you leverage their analysis in search and organization across your repositories, or amplify the utility of that analysis by joining data from structured databases. At the same time, most MAM and DAM solutions don t provide integrated machine learning analysis to extract insights and metadata from your assets. When they do, it s typically a handful of standard, pre-packaged analysis models that you can t change.  They don t provide a way to create custom analysis, chain together multiple algorithms, apply 3rd party models‚Äîor even train your own neural nets‚Äîto target your very own tough, domain-specific problems. They typically don t even let you do multi-modal search with multiple keywords. Zorroa Visual Intelligence does all of these things. Why does that difference matter? Simple asset analysis is only good for solving simple problems. Assset analysis that isn t integrated with organization, search and discovery is hardly useful at all. Zorroa is a system for targeting difficult, specific problems, creating impactful and measurable solutions, then making those solutions easy and automatic across vast and distributed asset collections. Why is that hard for existing computer vision companies to replicate? We are unique in attacking this space with a mindset developed from working successfully in the world of Visual FX. We share a worldview in which real value‚Äîthe kind of value that clearly distinguishes one company s solutions as being superior to its competition‚Äîcomes from being able to routinely create unexpected, elegant solutions for what was thought to be impossible. OPTIMAL ANALYSIS WITH MULTIPLE ALGORITHMS Zorroa s open, plug-in pipeline architecture allows you to utilize multiple algorithms simultaneously, enabling you to get the best search results, no matter the size, quality, or nature of your assets. ZVI can provide character recognition, image processing, metadata enrichment from structured databases, and more‚Äîall accessible within one dashboard. ENHANCED SEARCHABILITY Your digital visual assets are most valuable when they are well described and organized. Zorroa can enhance your current documents, images, and video and automatically organize new assets by attaching pertinent information from structured databases, so they can be searched and browsed successfully across more dimensions. CUSTOMIZED DIGITAL ASSET ANALYSIS The problems you are trying to solve with document, image, and video analysis are specific to your business, and your visual assets are unique. Unlike most solutions which offer generic, unmodifiable analysis, Zorroa leverages a combination of processors, so your business always has the most advanced and customizable analysis available. AUTOMATICALLY ORGANIZE ASSETS To make the most of your visual assets, which continue to grow exponentially over time, these documents, images, and video need to be consistently analyzed, tagged, and sorted.
